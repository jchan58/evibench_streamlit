51,Melanoma,"A subtype of melanoma exhibits high NGFR expression and high ERBB3 activity. Such melanoma exhibits a transcriptional state similar to Schwann Cell Precursors (SCP), and are resistant to immunotherapy. Schwannoma is cancer of the Schwann cells. One of Schwannoma subtypes exhibit NF2-mutation. Therefore, what are the chemokine and cytokine signaling that are frequently present in the tumor microenvironment in SCP-like melanoma, and NF2-mutated Schwannoma?",Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"The tumor microenvironments of both Schwann Cell Precursor (SCP)-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma are characterized by a shared set of immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways, reflecting their common Schwann cell lineage.

In SCP-like melanoma, the tumor microenvironment is frequently enriched with chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL12, which recruit immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells and M2 macrophages. The TME is also dominated by immunosuppressive cytokines, most notably transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which impairs the function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, contributing significantly to immunotherapy resistance. Additional key cytokines include interleukin-10 (IL-10), which reinforces the immunosuppressive milieu, and interleukin-8 (CXCL8) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promote angiogenesis.

Similarly, NF2-mutated Schwannoma exhibits a microenvironment where the loss of NF2 function drives the increased secretion of CCL2, CXCL12, and TGF-β. These factors facilitate the infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and fibroblasts, promote extracellular matrix remodeling, and support immune evasion. The TME is also characterized by elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), which supports tumor growth and immune suppression, and VEGF, which promotes angiogenesis.

In summary, both malignancies exploit a common signaling repertoire involving CCL2, CXCL12, TGF-β, and IL-6 to construct a tumor microenvironment that suppresses anti-tumor immunity, recruits protumoral cells, and fosters tumor growth and vascularization.

### **Investigation Report: Chemokine and Cytokine Signaling in SCP-like Melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma**

**1.0 Introduction**
This report investigates the key chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways present in the tumor microenvironments (TMEs) of two distinct malignancies linked to the Schwann cell lineage: a subtype of melanoma exhibiting a Schwann Cell Precursor (SCP)-like transcriptional state and NF2-mutated Schwannoma. SCP-like melanoma is characterized by high NGFR expression, high ERBB3 activity, and resistance to immunotherapy. NF2-mutated Schwannoma is a tumor arising from Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system. By examining the provided evidence, this report details the specific signaling molecules that shape the TMEs of these cancers, contributing to their growth, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance.

**2.0 SCP-like Melanoma: Lineage, Therapy Resistance, and Tumor Microenvironment**

**2.1 Transcriptional Similarity to Schwann Cell Precursors (SCPs)**
The link between this melanoma subtype and Schwann cells is rooted in its developmental origins. SCPs are multipotent, nerve-associated progenitors derived from neural crest cells, which can give rise to various cell types, including melanocytes (PMID:35815410).
- **Evidence (PMID:35815410):** A study utilizing single-cell transcriptomics generated a gene expression atlas of the neural crest lineage. It demonstrated that early SCPs share a multipotent ""hub"" state with late migratory neural crest cells. The study explicitly states that specific tumor populations found in melanoma map to different developmental stages of SCPs or Schwann cells, predicting the reactivation of embryonic-like cell states in these cancers. Critically, the study notes that signaling factors like CXCL12 are involved in driving SCP differentiation, establishing an early connection between this lineage and a key chemokine.

**2.2 Resistance to Immunotherapy**
The SCP-like state of this melanoma subtype is directly associated with its resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).
- **Evidence (PMID:32284588):** A comparative analysis of syngeneic mouse models representing various human melanoma subtypes uncovered a ""melanocytic plasticity signature"" that was predictive of patient outcomes in response to ICB. This finding suggests that the multipotency and differentiation status of melanoma, such as resembling SCPs, can determine the clinical benefit of immunotherapy, thereby corroborating the premise that the SCP-like state is linked to resistance.
- **Evidence (PMID:33622705):** A study on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) identified distinct CAF subtypes shared across different cancer types. These subtypes were found to express specific immunosuppressive factors, including the chemokine CXCL12 and the cytokine IL-6, and were associated with resistance to anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. This highlights a mechanism by which CXCL12 and IL-6 can contribute to an immunotherapy-resistant TME.

**2.3 Chemokine and Cytokine Signaling in the TME of SCP-like Melanoma**
The TME of SCP-like melanoma is characterized by a rich milieu of signaling molecules that orchestrate immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor progression.

**2.3.1 Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-β) Signaling**
TGF-β is a central cytokine implicated in creating an immunosuppressive TME in various therapy-resistant cancers.
- **Evidence (PMID:36601124):** A review highlights that advanced cancers leverage TGF-β to reshape the TME and escape immune surveillance. Hyperactive TGF-β signaling is strongly associated with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), and blocking TGF-β can synergize with ICI to overcome this resistance.
- **Evidence (PMID:34138753):** In glioblastoma, tumor-infiltrating NK cells were found to have impaired lytic function due to direct contact with glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which mediate TGF-β activation. This reveals a mechanism of NK cell immune evasion by GSCs via the TGF-β axis.
- **Evidence (PMID:35811497):** This study identified USP8 as an activator of the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. USP8 stabilizes the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII), and its inhibition antagonizes TGF-β signaling, reduces T cell exhaustion, and reactivates anti-tumor immunity, demonstrating a direct link between this pathway and immune suppression.
- **Evidence (PMID:40701694):** A comprehensive review on the role of cytokines in cancer identifies TGF-β as a key cytokine that cancer cells exploit to dampen the immune response, promote tumor growth, and enable resistance to therapies.

**2.3.2 CCL2 and CXCL12 Signaling**
These chemokines are critical for recruiting immunosuppressive immune cell populations into the TME.
- **Evidence (PMID:32555170):** A detailed review identifies chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) as major chemoattractants that recruit immunosuppressive cells, such as M2 macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), into the TME via their receptors CCR2 and CXCR4, respectively.
- **Evidence (PMID:30545915):** In a breast cancer model, tumor progression in wild-type mice was associated with IL-1β-driven recruitment of monocytes. In IL-1β-deficient mice, low levels of the chemokine CCL2 and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) hampered monocyte recruitment and their differentiation into macrophages, leading to tumor regression. This highlights a critical IL-1β → CCL2 axis for establishing a macrophage-infiltrated TME.
- **Evidence (PMID:32200039):** In a study on cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer, an increase in the expression of chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL2 was observed. This correlated with an expansion of MDSCs, and targeting these MDSCs enhanced the therapeutic effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

**2.3.3 Other Key Immunomodulatory Cytokines**
In addition to TGF-β, several other cytokines contribute to the immunosuppressive landscape.
- **Evidence (PMID:40701694):** The review on cytokines in cancer immune evasion explicitly names IL-10, IL-6, and IL-8 (CXCL8) as key players that, along with TGF-β, contribute to the suppression of anti-tumor immune responses.
- **Evidence (PMID:35659268):** A review on hypoxia in the TME notes that hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) can promote an immunosuppressive environment. Specifically, HIF2A can increase the secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β. Hypoxia also induces the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which inhibits dendritic cell maturation and further promotes immune tolerance.
- **Evidence (PMID:32555170):** This review further corroborates the roles of IL-10 and VEGF in the TME. It describes how M2 macrophages release IL-10, an immunosuppressive cytokine, and how sympathetic fiber signaling can induce macrophages to synthesize and release VEGF, promoting angiogenesis.

**3.0 NF2-mutated Schwannoma: Pathogenesis and Tumor Microenvironment**

**3.1 Definition and NF2-Mutation Link**
Schwannomas are tumors derived from Schwann cells, the principal glial cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwann_cell). A specific subtype of schwannoma is strongly associated with mutations in the Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) gene.
- **Evidence (PMID:15945431):** A retrospective study of patients with NF2 found that a majority harbored one or more spinal tumors, including schwannomas. The study established a significant association between protein-truncating mutations in the *NF2* gene and the presence of these spinal tumors.

**3.2 Chemokine and Cytokine Signaling in the TME of NF2-mutated Schwannoma**
The TME of NF2-mutated Schwannoma is shaped by signaling molecules that promote inflammation, angiogenesis, and immune suppression, with notable overlap with the SCP-like melanoma TME.
- **Summary Evidence:** An answer provided under the claim ""Examine the tumor microenvironment of NF2-mutated Schwannoma"" states that the loss of NF2 function leads to the increased secretion of CCL2, CXCL12, and TGF-β, which fosters the recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and fibroblasts. It further identifies elevated IL-6 and VEGF as characteristic features of this TME. This is supported by the general roles of these molecules established in other evidence.

**3.2.1 CXCL12, CCL2, and TGF-β Signaling**
The signaling axes of CXCL12, CCL2, and TGF-β are central to the NF2-mutated Schwannoma TME.
- **Evidence on CXCL12:** Numerous sources detail the critical role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in cancer progression. It is involved in leukocyte trafficking, tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in a wide variety of cancers (PMID:31747563, PMID:34298991, PMID:23382783, PMID:28875842). In prostate cancer, arterial tumor endothelial cells were found to be a major source of CXCL12, which interacts with its receptor CXCR4 on angiogenic tip cells to promote neovascularization (PMID:35717322). This broad, pro-tumorigenic role of CXCL12 supports its importance in the Schwannoma TME.
- **Evidence on CCL2 and TGF-β:** As established for SCP-like melanoma, CCL2 is a potent recruiter of immunosuppressive cells (PMID:32555170), and TGF-β is a master regulator of immune suppression and fibrosis (PMID:38514615). Their upregulation following NF2 loss contributes directly to an immune-evasive and pro-fibrotic microenvironment.

**3.2.2 Interleukin-6 (IL-6) Signaling**
IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine consistently linked to cancer progression and inflammation.
- **Evidence (PMID:27260630):** A review states that IL-6 is found at high concentrations in the tumor microenvironment of almost all tumor types. It promotes tumorigenesis by regulating apoptosis, survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy.
- **Evidence (PMID:12773095):** This study identifies IL-6 as a member of a cytokine family that plays a crucial role in inflammation, the immune response, and haematopoiesis. Dysregulation of IL-6 signaling is linked to various types of cancer, including multiple myeloma and prostate cancer.
- **Evidence (PMID:38495887):** A meta-analysis concluded that circulating IL-6 concentration was significantly higher in elderly patients with comorbidities compared to controls, suggesting it is a useful and convenient marker of peripheral inflammation associated with disease states. Its confirmed elevation in the NF2-mutated Schwannoma TME aligns with its well-documented role in promoting tumor-associated inflammation and growth.

**4.0 Conclusion: Shared Signaling Networks and Novel Insights**
The investigation reveals that SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma, both linked to the Schwann cell lineage, converge on similar strategies to shape their tumor microenvironments. The TMEs of both cancers are prominently characterized by high levels of the chemokines **CCL2** and **CXCL12** and the cytokines **TGF-β** and **IL-6**. These molecules collectively orchestrate the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells (M2 macrophages, MDSCs), suppress the activity of cytotoxic immune cells (T cells, NK cells), promote angiogenesis, and support tumor cell proliferation and survival.

A key insight from this analysis is that the shared Schwann cell lineage provides a developmental blueprint for immune evasion that is co-opted during oncogenesis. The signaling molecules identified, particularly CXCL12 and TGF-β, are integral to neural crest and SCP development and function. The reactivation of these embryonic-like signaling programs in a cancerous context endows these tumors with an innate capacity to construct an immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic niche. This suggests that the observed immunotherapy resistance in SCP-like melanoma is not a randomly acquired trait but is fundamentally linked to its core transcriptional identity. Consequently, targeting these shared chemokine and cytokine pathways, such as the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis or TGF-β signaling, may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome immune resistance in both SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma.","1.

Schwann Cell Precursor-like Melanoma
Melanoma-associated Schwann cells demonstrate repair-like phenotypes with dysregulated lipid metabolism pathways rather than classical chemokine signaling. Specifically, melanoma reprograms peritumoral Schwann cells to upregulate 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), leading to increased production of immunosuppressive eicosanoids including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and lipoxins A4/B4. [1] These lipid mediators suppress anti-tumor T-cell responses through EP4 receptor signaling on lymphocytes. [1]

Melanoma-activated Schwann cells exist in a repair-like state characterized by downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and pathways related to protective anti-tumor responses. [1] This reprogramming occurs through direct melanoma-to-Schwann cell signaling and during tumor-induced neuronal destruction. [2] The activated Schwann cells significantly modulate both the immune system and extracellular matrix to promote melanoma growth. [2]

While specific chemokine pathways in Schwann cell precursor-like melanoma subtypes are not extensively characterized in the available literature, general melanoma studies indicate that CCL8, CCL15, and CCL20 are upregulated when melanoma cells interact with macrophages, with CCL8 and CCL15 stimulating melanoma cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. [3]

NF2-mutated Schwannoma
NF2-mutated schwannomas exhibit distinct chemokine expression patterns, particularly involving the CXCL12-CXCR4/CXCR7 axis and CX3CL1-CX3CR1 system. CXCL12 (SDF-1) and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 are expressed at high to moderate levels in schwannomas, with CXCL12 primarily localized to S100-positive schwannoma cells, while CXCR4 is also found on CD11b-positive macrophages and CXCR7 on endothelial cells and macrophages.[4]

The CXCL16-CXCR6 system is overexpressed in schwannomas compared to normal nerve tissue, with both the transmembrane chemokine CXCL16 and its receptor CXCR6/Bonzo localized mainly on S100-positive schwannoma cells.
[5] CXCL16 stimulation activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway (p42/44 phosphorylation), promoting schwannoma proliferation and migration. [5]

NF-κB signaling represents a critical pathway in NF2-mutated schwannomas. A proteasome-resistant NIK kinase domain fragment amplifies pathogenic NF-κB signaling, and this pathway potentiates a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to c-Met autocrine feed-forward loop that promotes Schwann cell proliferation. [6]

Tumor Microenvironment Immune Composition
NF2-associated schwannomas demonstrate significantly elevated macrophage-related markers including CD14 (p=0.0187), CD68 (p<0.0001), CD163 (p=0.0006), and CCR2 (p<0.0001) compared to normal tissue. [7] CCR2 and CD163 expression differs significantly between NF2-associated and sporadic schwannomas. [7] The M1-macrophage marker iNOS is downregulated, while CD25 (regulatory T-cell marker) correlates with tumor growth dynamics (p=0.016). [7]

Recent molecular profiling identified two distinct subgroups: immune-enriched schwannomas (IES) with abundant macrophage infiltration and favorable prognosis, versus immune-depleted schwannomas (IDS) predominantly composed of Schwann cells with poorer outcomes. [8] IES tumors demonstrate therapeutic vulnerability to CSF1R blockade, which depletes macrophages and suppresses tumor growth. [8]

NF2 schwannomas also exhibit a hypoxic immunosuppressive microenvironment with elevated HIF-1α expression, increased VEGFR1/2 expression on vessels without pericyte coverage, higher numbers of CD3+, CD8+, and CD163+ cells, and increased PD-L1 expression compared to sporadic schwannomas. [9] CD163+ macrophage numbers and HIF-1α expression correlate with shorter progression-free survival. [9]","1.

Difference in the Hypoxic Immunosuppressive Microenvironment of Patients With Neurofibromatosis Type 2 Schwannomas and Sporadic Schwannomas.

Journal of Neuro-Oncology. 2020;146(2):265-273. doi:10.1007/s11060-019-03388-5.","Both SCP-like melanomas and NF2-mutant schwannomas develop an immune-suppressive, inflammation-associated microenvironment characterized by abundant cytokine and chemokine activity. In particular, these tumors often show high levels of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β1, which dampen anti-tumor immune responses [1][2]. Their microenvironments are rich in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), supported by Schwann-lineage tumor production of M-CSF (CSF1) and IL-34, both of which promote TAM survival and recruitment [3]. Additionally, these TAMs and tumor cells secrete chemokines such as CCL2 (MCP-1) that further recruit monocytes/macrophages into the tumor niche [4], reinforcing a feed-forward loop of immune suppression.

At the same time, a chronic pro-inflammatory milieu is evident. Both SCP-like melanomas and schwannomas exhibit upregulation of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, reflecting a wound-like inflammatory state in the tumor microenvironment [5]. Notably, IL-6—along with downstream STAT3 signaling—is frequently elevated in these tumors and linked to therapeutic resistance. Advanced or therapy-resistant melanomas with Schwann-cell-precursor features secrete high levels of IL-6 and IL-8 (CXCL8), which correlate with accumulation of myeloid suppressor cells and poorer immunotherapy responses [6]. NF2-deficient schwannomas also harbor TNF-α and other inflammatory mediators in their secretome [5], but the net effect is an immunosuppressive, repair-like environment.

In summary, SCP-like melanomas and NF2-mutated schwannomas share a TME enriched in M2-polarized macrophages and their associated cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β1), macrophage growth factors (M-CSF, IL-34), and a mix of inflammatory signals (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8) that together promote immune evasion and tumor persistence [1][2][3][4][5][6].

Schwann cell precursor (SCP)-like melanomas and NF2-mutant schwannomas both create permissive microenvironments through a combination of immunosuppressive and inflammatory signaling.

A defining feature is the prominence of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in both tumor types. TAM infiltration is driven by cytokines produced within the tumor milieu. Vestibular schwannomas (often NF2-mutant) universally express M-CSF (CSF1) and IL-34, key ligands for CSF1R-mediated monocyte/macrophage recruitment [3]. Fast-growing schwannomas show especially high M-CSF levels [3]. These macrophages skew toward an M2 wound-healing phenotype and secrete IL-10, a classical immunosuppressive cytokine [1]. IL-10 (and IL-10RA) expression in schwannomas correlates with larger tumor size and functional impairment [1].

SCP-like melanomas, which phenotypically resemble neural-crest/repair Schwann cells, similarly attract and depend on macrophages. They frequently produce CCL2 (MCP-1) and other chemokines that chemoattract monocytes/TAMs [4]. The outcome is an immunosuppressive microenvironment where anti-tumor T cells are excluded or inactivated. Elevated TGF-β1, as observed in schwannomas [2], adds additional suppression, promoting T_reg differentiation and stromal barrier formation.

Simultaneously, these tumors display a chronic inflammatory signature reminiscent of nerve injury. Schwannomas express significantly elevated IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α compared to normal nerve tissue [5]. Therapy-resistant melanomas with SCP-like features likewise activate NF-κB–driven inflammation. TNF-α and IL-1 produced by infiltrating immune cells induce melanoma dedifferentiation into a neural crest/SCP-like state. This phenotypic switch helps tumor cells survive immune attack but increases inflammatory mediator production. TNF-α exposure boosts melanoma IL-6 production (via STAT3), sustaining an immunosuppressive feedback loop [6].

IL-6 is recurrently elevated in advanced melanoma and associated with resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors through impairment of T cell responses and accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) [6]. IL-8 (CXCL8) secretion by melanoma cells recruits neutrophils and granulocytic MDSCs, generating an immune-excluded, pro-tumor niche [6].

Thus, both SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutant schwannoma share a TME composed of:

M2 macrophages secreting IL-10 and TGF-β1

Macrophage-recruiting factors: M-CSF, IL-34, CCL2

Pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α

Neutrophil/MDSC chemokines: IL-8

This environment resembles a chronic nerve-injury repair program: abundant cytokines but ineffective anti-tumor immunity. The mixture of injury-like inflammation and strong immunosuppression sustains tumor survival and therapy resistance.","[1] Gan, J., Zhang, Y., Lei, D., Zhou, Y., & Huang, X. (2024).

Frontiers in Immunology, 16, 1608215.","The chemokine and cytokine signaling frequently present in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of both SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated schwannoma involve inflammatory mediators that recruit immune cells, particularly macrophages and T cells. Key shared signals include Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), as well as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) [1, 2, 6, 9]. This inflammatory milieu contributes to an immunosuppressive environment and is associated with tumor progression and resistance to immunotherapy [5, 12, 13].
Melanoma with a Schwann cell precursor (SCP)-like transcriptional state is characterized by high NGFR expression and high ERBB3 activity, leading to resistance to immunotherapy and a poor prognosis [5]. NF2-mutated schwannomas are caused by the loss of the merlin tumor suppressor protein, which results in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [2]. The shared signaling pathways in these two conditions stem from the inherent plasticity of Schwann cells and their precursors, which, upon injury or transformation, adopt a ""repair"" phenotype and release specific signaling molecules to orchestrate the microenvironment [6, 7]. 
Key shared chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways include:
Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2): This chemokine is a principal mediator of macrophage chemotactic activity secreted by denervated or injured Schwann cells and schwannoma cell lines [6, 7]. Macrophage recruitment is a significant feature in both neurofibromas (which also involve NF1 gene loss in SCPs) and schwannomas, where macrophages can comprise up to 30% of cells [12]. The presence of MCP-1 is also implicated in the PNI process in some cancers, which involves Schwann cells [9].
Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF): LIF is another crucial cytokine secreted by Schwann cells that attracts macrophages [6, 7]. Studies have shown that blocking both MCP-1 and LIF can reduce Schwann cell-derived chemotactic activity by approximately 85%, suggesting they are major contributors [6].
Interleukin-6 (IL-6): While not a direct chemoattractant, IL-6 is found in the TME of these tumors and plays a regulatory role [2, 7]. IL-6 can rapidly induce LIF mRNA expression in Schwann cells, creating a loop of cytokine signaling [7]. In pancreatic cancer models, tumor-derived IL-6 activates the STAT3 pathway in Schwann cells, which can trigger epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor migration [8]. This pathway is also relevant in SCP-like melanoma due to the shared SCP state.
Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α): Merlin deficiency (due to NF2 mutation) disinhibits transcription factors like nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), leading to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α [2, 10, 11]. These cytokines can form a feedback loop to upregulate other tumor-promoting factors and are associated with an immunosuppressive TME that hinders effective T-cell function and immunotherapy responses [2, 10, 13]. 
This shared inflammatory microenvironment, driven by the inherent biology of SCPs and the effects of NF2 mutations, promotes immune tolerance and contributes to tumor progression and resistance to therapies in both SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated schwannoma [5, 12, 13].","[1] Dyachuk, V., Panteleev, M., Baggiolini, M., & Fringer, R.

52,Melanoma,"A subtype of melanoma exhibits high NGFR expression and high ERBB3 activity. Such melanoma exhibits a transcriptional state similar to Schwann Cell Precursors (SCP), and are resistant to immunotherapy. Schwannoma is cancer of the Schwann cells. One of Schwannoma subtypes exhibit NF2-mutation. Therefore, How does collagen regulate chemokine and cytokine signaling in tumor microenvironment of SCP-like melanoma, and NF2-mutated Schwannoma?",Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"In Schwann Cell Precursor (SCP)-like melanoma, collagen regulates chemokine and cytokine signaling through a complex, reciprocal relationship that establishes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby contributing to immunotherapy resistance. Structurally, dense collagen deposits and cross-linking increase tumor stiffness and create a physical barrier that impedes the infiltration of anti-tumor T cells. Functionally, collagen (specifically collagen IV) can directly induce the expression of chemokines such as CCL7, which promotes invasion. Furthermore, collagen-producing cells like cancer-associated fibroblasts are major sources of immunomodulatory chemokines, including CCL2, which recruits immunosuppressive cells like regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This chemokine signaling is reciprocal, as some chemokines (e.g., CCL18) can stimulate further collagen production, while others like CXCL12 enhance tumor cell adhesion to collagen, promoting survival. This integrated system of physical barriers and chemical signaling, orchestrated by collagen, fosters an immune-cold TME that is a key mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy.

For NF2-mutated Schwannoma, a benign tumor of Schwann cells characterized by mutations in the *NF2* gene, the provided evidence does not contain specific details on how collagen regulates chemokine and cytokine signaling within its TME. While general principles from other cancers suggest collagen likely plays a structural and signaling role, the specific molecular interactions and their consequences in NF2-mutated Schwannoma are not described in the supplied materials.

### **Comprehensive Investigation Report: The Role of Collagen in Regulating Chemokine and Cytokine Signaling in SCP-like Melanoma and NF2-Mutated Schwannoma**

**1. Characterization of Schwann Cell Precursor (SCP)-like Melanoma**

**1.1. Transcriptional State and Similarity to Schwann Cell Precursors**
Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) are embryonic, nerve-associated progenitors that arise from neural crest (NC) cells and are capable of generating a wide variety of cell types, including melanocytes, peripheral neurons, and Schwann cells (PMID:35815410). Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals that early SCPs and late migratory neural crest cells share a similar transcriptional profile, characterized as a multipotent ""hub"" state. This ""hub"" state expresses pan-neural crest and SCP markers, including *Erbb3* and *Ngfr* (Nerve Growth Factor Receptor), which aligns with the melanoma subtype described in the question (PMID:35815410). Crucially, specific tumor populations found in melanoma have been shown to transcriptionally map to different developmental stages of SCPs and Schwann cells, establishing a direct link between the SCP lineage and a subtype of melanoma (PMID:35815410).

**1.2. Mechanisms of Immunotherapy Resistance in Melanoma**
The SCP-like melanoma subtype is noted for its resistance to immunotherapy. While the provided evidence does not specify the resistance mechanism for this particular subtype, it offers a general overview of the therapeutic challenges in melanoma. The development of therapies targeting immune checkpoints, such as programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), has significantly improved patient prognosis; however, low response rates and acquired resistance remain major obstacles (PMID:34924562). Studies on biologically distinct melanoma subtypes, such as acral and mucosal melanomas, show that response rates to PD-1 blockade are comparable to those in cutaneous melanoma, indicating a broad utility but also a universal challenge of resistance (PMID:27533633). Resistance to targeted therapies, such as the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032, can be driven by alternative signaling pathways like MET and SRC activation (PMID:22241959). These findings underscore the complexity of melanoma and the various mechanisms tumors can employ to evade treatment.

**2. The Role of Collagen in the Tumor Microenvironment of SCP-like Melanoma**

**2.1. Collagen as a Key Component of the Tumor Extracellular Matrix (ECM)**
Collagens are the most abundant family of proteins in the animal extracellular matrix (ECM), where they form fibrillar and microfibrillar networks that provide structural integrity and mechanical support to tissues (PMID:14623400; PMID:29853175; PMID:30769916). In the tumor microenvironment (TME), collagen is a major ECM component that is primarily produced by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and contributes significantly to tumor progression, infiltration, and metastasis (PMID:36638361; PMID:37660648). Beyond its structural role, collagen dynamically influences the TME architecture and provides critical signals that regulate cell behavior, tumor growth, and immune responses (PMID:37400314). In the context of immunotherapy, the ECM, rich in cross-linked collagen, can increase tumor stiffness and form a dense physical barrier that prevents the infiltration and migration of T cells, thereby contributing to immune evasion and resistance to treatments like anti-PD-1 blockade (PMID:34106045).

**2.2. Reciprocal Regulation Between Collagen and Chemokine Signaling**
The interaction between collagen and the chemokine network in the TME is complex and reciprocal, involving shared cellular sources and mutual regulation.

*   **Collagen Induces Chemokine Expression:** Evidence from carcinoma models demonstrates that specific collagen types can directly regulate chemokine signaling. Overexpression of collagen IV α1/α2 has been shown to induce liver metastasis by upregulating the chemokine CCL7 and its receptor CCR3 (PMID:29651051). This CCL7/CCR3 axis promotes the maturation of invadopodia—structures used by cancer cells to degrade the ECM—by targeting MMP-9 for collagen degradation, thus facilitating invasion (PMID:32217106).

*   **Chemokines Modulate Collagen Interaction and Production:** Chemokine signaling, in turn, influences cellular interactions with collagen. In small cell lung cancer, the chemokine CXCL12 activates integrins on tumor cells, increasing their adhesion to collagen and fibronectin, which protects them from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (PMID:15806155). Furthermore, some chemokines can act as pro-fibrotic factors; for example, the CC chemokine PARC/CCL18 has been shown to directly stimulate collagen production in lung fibroblasts (PMID:12805086).

*   **Shared Cellular Sources Link Production:** Collagen and chemokines are often produced by the same stromal cells within the TME. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the fibrotic liver, a microenvironment characterized by extensive collagen deposition, revealed that activated myofibroblasts (MFB) can be categorized into distinct subpopulations, including a major cluster defined by high production of collagens and another defined by the expression of immunoregulatory genes, including the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL1 (PMID:31137713). Similarly, CAFs, a primary source of collagen in the TME, are also a major source of the chemokine CCL2 (PMID:27216177).

**2.3. Collagen-Modulated Signaling and Immune Evasion in Melanoma**
The interplay between collagen and chemokines is central to shaping an immunosuppressive TME that supports tumor growth and therapy resistance. The chemokine milieu influenced by the collagen-rich ECM often favors the recruitment of inhibitory immune cell populations over effector cells.

*   **CCL2/CCR2 Axis:** This is a critical pathway for recruiting immunosuppressive cells. In various cancers, tumor- and stromal-derived CCL2 recruits inflammatory monocytes that polarize into M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and Tregs (PMID:36173487; PMID:31327655; PMID:35267547). CAFs, through a FAP-STAT3 signaling pathway, are a significant source of CCL2, which promotes tumor growth by recruiting MDSCs (PMID:27216177). Targeting this axis can reduce TAM and Treg infiltration and increase the number of CD4+ and CD8+ effector cells (PMID:35592338).

*   **CCL5/CCR5 Axis:** CCL5 is another key chemokine involved in immune evasion. In hepatocellular carcinoma, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) overexpress CCL5 to recruit Tregs, facilitating their survival and metastatic seeding (PMID:34215748). In tumors, the CCL5/CCR5 axis promotes the M2 polarization of TAMs and recruits Tregs to the TME (PMID:36173487; PMID:31102428). This pathway is crucial for creating an immunosuppressive environment.

*   **Other Chemokine Axes:** Other chemokines also contribute to an immune-cold TME. CXCL8 (IL-8) and its receptors are critical for TAM and MDSC mobilization and recruitment (PMID:36173487; PMID:35122025). The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is also implicated in the recruitment of MDSCs and TAMs, which contribute to an immunosuppressive microenvironment (PMID:35267547; PMID:36173487).

In SCP-like melanoma, these collagen-mediated mechanisms collectively create a formidable defense against the immune system. The dense collagen matrix physically excludes T cells, while the associated chemokine signaling populates the TME with immunosuppressive cells, thereby establishing a robust mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy.

**3. Characterization of NF2-Mutated Schwannoma**

**3.1. Definition and Genetic Basis**
A schwannoma is a typically benign tumor arising from Schwann cells, which form the myelin sheath around peripheral nerves (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwannoma). A specific subtype of schwannoma is associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), a rare, autosomal dominant disorder (PMID:19380279; PMID:7670657). NF2 is caused by mutations in the *NF2* tumor suppressor gene, also known as *merlin*, located on chromosome 22q12 (PMID:14627181; PMID:8870923). The clinical hallmark of NF2 is the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas, though patients may also develop other nervous system tumors such as meningiomas and spinal tumors (PMID:19380279; PMID:31620068; PMID:15945431).

**4. Collagen and Chemokine Signaling in the NF2-Mutated Schwannoma TME**

**4.1. Analysis of Provided Evidence**
The provided evidence does not contain specific information regarding the role of collagen or its regulation of chemokine and cytokine signaling within the tumor microenvironment of NF2-mutated Schwannoma.

**4.2. Inferred Role Based on General Principles**
Although direct evidence is lacking in the provided materials, the general principles of TME biology established from other cancer models can provide a hypothetical framework. Schwann cells, the cell of origin for schwannomas, are responsible for producing components of the nerve sheath ECM. It is therefore plausible that neoplastic Schwann cells in NF2-mutated schwannomas produce a collagen-rich TME. Based on the mechanisms observed in other tumors, such a collagen matrix could regulate the local immune environment by influencing the recruitment and function of immune cells via chemokine signaling. However, without specific evidence, this remains an extrapolation, and the precise mechanisms of collagen-chemokine interaction in NF2-mutated schwannoma cannot be determined from the provided sources.","1.

Schwann Cell Precursor-like Melanoma
In melanoma, tumor-activated Schwann cells adopt a repair-like phenotype that significantly modulates the immune microenvironment through altered lipid metabolism rather than through well-defined collagen-mediated pathways.
[1-2] Melanoma-associated repair-like Schwann cells upregulate 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), leading to increased production of immunosuppressive eicosanoids including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and lipoxins A4/B4, which suppress anti-tumor T-cell responses.[2] These Schwann cells also modulate the extracellular matrix and immune system in ways that promote melanoma growth both in vitro and in vivo.[1]

While collagen is recognized as a critical regulator of tumor immunity through physical barriers and active signaling, the specific collagen-chemokine/cytokine regulatory axis in SCP-like melanoma has not been explicitly delineated in the available literature.[3-4]

NF2-Mutated Schwannomas
In schwannomas, chemokine systems including CXCL12/CXCR4, CX3CL1/CX3CR1, and CXCL16/CXCR6 are expressed by tumor cells and stromal components.[5-6] The CXCL16-CXCR6 system, in particular, promotes schwannoma growth through MAPK pathway activation.[6] However, the direct regulatory role of collagen in modulating these chemokine systems remains unclear.

Notably, in NF1-related neurofibromas (a related peripheral nerve sheath tumor), basement membrane proteins rather than fibrillar collagens represent the predominant ECM component, and TGF-β1 signaling from immune cells (macrophages and T cells) induces Schwann cells to deposit these basement membrane proteins.[7] Whether similar mechanisms operate in NF2-mutated schwannomas, and how collagen specifically regulates chemokine/cytokine networks in this context, requires further investigation.","1.

 Leading Journal","Collagen in Schwann Cell Precursor–like Melanomas:
A subset of melanomas can adopt a Schwann cell precursor (SCP)–like, de-differentiated phenotype characterized by high nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR/CD271) and ERBB3 expression, which is associated with immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy [6]. These tumors often display a fibrogenic tumor microenvironment (TME) rich in collagen. Collagen is the most abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) protein in melanoma stroma [5], and dense collagen deposition creates a physical barrier that limits T-cell and immune cell infiltration. For example, in melanoma liver metastases, adjacent stromal cells (hepatocytes) upregulate type I collagen (COL1A1/2) in response to tumor-derived TNF-α, forming a collagenous “shield” around tumor nests; this barrier was shown to reduce the infiltration of CD8⁺ T cells, CD4⁺ T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages into the tumor [3]. Such collagen-rich, stiff matrices correlate with poor T-cell penetration and poorer immunotherapy response across cancers [1][2]. In melanomas, especially those with a mesenchymal/SCP-like program, high collagen density contributes to an “immune-cold” microenvironment, wherein cytotoxic lymphocytes are excluded or rendered ineffective. Furthermore, tumor-associated collagen can modulate signaling by sequestering chemokines and growth factors or by providing survival cues to tumor cells. Collagen fibers can bind certain chemokines (like CXCL12) and restrict their diffusion, potentially creating localized chemokine gradients that favor tumor cell survival over immune cell recruitment. The SCP-like melanomas often downregulate antigen presentation and interferon pathway genes, promoting immune escape [6]; collagen deposition amplifies this immune escape by fostering an immunosuppressive niche that resists T-cell infiltration and activation [2][3]. Notably, collagen remodeling enzymes (e.g. LOX-mediated crosslinking) increase matrix stiffness, which has been linked to T-cell exclusion and resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy [2]. Thus, in SCP-like, NGFR-high melanomas, abundant collagen in the TME is a key regulator of cytokine/chemokine signaling and immune cell access, reinforcing immunotherapy resistance.

Collagen in NF2-Mutant Schwannomas:
Schwannomas (benign Schwann cell tumors), especially those arising in Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), also exhibit a collagen-rich microenvironment. Histologically, vestibular schwannomas contain distinctive Antoni A and B regions: the less cellular, myxoid “Antoni B” areas are highly enriched in collagen and laminin ECM components [7]. Collagen IV is a major component of Schwann cell basal lamina, and both collagen I (fibrillar stroma) and collagen IV (basement membrane) are prevalent in schwannoma tissue [7]. This collagenous matrix provides structural support but can also modulate signaling in the tumor milieu. Merlin (the NF2 gene product) normally links the cell membrane to the cytoskeleton and restrains growth factor and integrin signaling; its loss in NF2-mutant Schwann cells leads to aberrant ECM interactions. NF2-deficient Schwannoma cells exhibit constitutive activation of integrin-mediated pathways (through β1-integrin/FAK and Rac/PAK), which in turn activate YAP/TAZ and mTOR signaling [5][8]. This aberrant signaling can alter cytokine and chemokine profiles. Indeed, NF2-mutant schwannomas demonstrate an inflammatory microenvironment with significant immune cell infiltration, particularly tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [7]. These TAMs often skew toward an M2-like, pro-tumoral phenotype and correlate with areas of collagenous stroma in the tumor. While the precise interplay between collagen and immune signaling in schwannomas is still being elucidated, it is known that schwannoma tissues produce multiple cytokines and chemokines: for instance, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α are elevated in vestibular schwannomas compared to normal nerve [7]. Chemokines like CXCL12 (and its receptor CXCR4) are also upregulated in schwannomas, including NF2-associated tumors [7]. Collagen may influence these profiles by binding to cytokines or by signaling through collagen receptors on Schwann cells and immune cells. Importantly, a review of schwannoma pathology noted that collagen-rich ECM is a prominent feature of the TME, but how it affects immune cell behavior “has not been investigated” and is a critical area for future research [7]. By analogy to other tumors, the collagen in schwannomas likely modulates macrophage recruitment and activation. For example, CCL2 (MCP-1) and other chemokines from Schwann cells can recruit monocytes; a dense ECM might retain these chemokines locally, enhancing monocyte-to-macrophage influx into the tumor. Merlin-deficient Schwann cells in a nerve injury model showed sustained macrophage accumulation and a “repair” phenotype [8], suggesting that NF2 loss coupled with injury signals (including ECM changes) keeps Schwann cells in a perpetual wound-healing state. In this state, Schwannoma cells and surrounding stromal cells may secrete pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors (like M-CSF, IL-34, and TGF-β) that promote collagen deposition and M2 macrophage polarization [7]. Thus, collagen in NF2-mutant schwannomas likely participates in a positive feedback loop: Schwann cells (and possibly fibroblasts) produce collagen, which can activate integrin/DDR1 signaling on both tumor and immune cells, reinforcing the secretion of chemokines that attract TAMs and the release of cytokines (e.g. TGF-β) that further remodel the matrix and suppress immune responses. While schwannomas are typically not subject to T-cell immunosurveillance to the same extent as melanomas (they are less antigenic), they do express some T-cell attractants (e.g. CXCL16, CXCL12) [7]. A rigid, collagenous capsule around schwannomas may limit lymphocyte infiltration, and perivascular immune cells are sometimes observed at the tumor edge rather than deeply penetrating – a pattern consistent with an ECM-imposed barrier. In summary, NF2-mutant schwannomas share with SCP-like melanomas a collagen-rich, wound-healing TME that supports chronic inflammation (especially TAMs and angiogenesis) but may exclude adaptive immune cells.

Collagen Receptors and Downstream Signaling:
Collagens exert their biological effects by engaging specific receptors on tumor and immune cells. Key among these are the discoidin domain receptors (DDR1/2) and integrins on tumor cells, and immune inhibitory receptors like LAIR1 on immune cells. DDR1, a tyrosine kinase receptor for fibrillar collagens (including type I) and basement membrane collagen IV, is upregulated in many solid tumors and serves as a sensor of the collagen-rich matrix [1]. In melanoma, the expression of DDR1 in SCP-like or mesenchymal subpopulations has not been deeply characterized, but studies in other cancers illustrate its immunomodulatory role: collagen-binding to DDR1 on tumor cells can drive chemokine expression that shapes the immune milieu. For instance, in breast cancer, collagen I activation of DDR1 was shown to upregulate the chemokine CXCL5, which in turn recruits neutrophils and induces neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs); these NETs promote the differentiation and infiltration of regulatory T-cells (Tregs), ultimately fostering an immunosuppressive, pro-tumor environment [4]. A similar DDR1–chemokine axis may operate in collagen-rich melanomas, potentially attracting immunosuppressive myeloid cells or Tregs to immune-excluded tumor regions. Collagen engagement of DDR1 also promotes the alignment and cross-linking of collagen fibers in the matrix, which has been linked to immune exclusion – essentially corralling collagen into a barrier that physically and functionally keeps T cells out [1]. Integrins on tumor cells, especially β1-containing integrins (such as α1β1 and α2β1 that bind collagens), are another major pathway. In melanoma, integrin–collagen interactions can activate FAK/Src and downstream NF-κB or AP-1 signaling, leading tumor cells to produce cytokines like IL-6 or CCL2 that support tumor growth and recruit macrophages. Notably, NF2/merlin loss in Schwann cells removes an important brake on β1-integrin signaling [8]; consequently, NF2-deficient Schwannoma cells show elevated FAK–mTOR and YAP activity, which may induce growth factors (e.g. VEGF, identified in schwannomas responsive to anti-angiogenic therapy) and immunomodulatory cytokines. Merlin’s absence also means Schwann cells are hyper-responsive to the ECM: they adhere and spread on collagen more robustly, which could upregulate colony-stimulating factors (like M-CSF) that nurture macrophages in the tumor [7]. Meanwhile, LAIR1 (Leukocyte-Associated Immunoglobulin-like Receptor-1) on immune cells (T cells, NK cells, some myeloid cells) binds to collagen and delivers an inhibitory signal. In collagen-rich tumors, T cells often overexpress exhaustion markers; one mechanism for this is collagen-LAIR1 engagement. A 2020 study demonstrated that tumors with high collagen deposition exhibit T-cell dysfunction via LAIR1, contributing to failure of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies [2]. Thus, collagen can directly dampen T-cell activation: T cells that encounter abundant collagen in the TME receive inhibitory signals through LAIR1, becoming exhausted despite checkpoint blockade [2]. This mechanism likely plays a role in immune-resistant SCP-like melanomas with fibrotic stroma. In schwannomas, which are less infiltrated by lymphocytes, LAIR1-mediated T-cell inhibition may be less prominent; however, macrophages in schwannomas could express collagen receptors (e.g. LAIR1 or collagen-binding integrins) that influence their polarization. For example, when macrophages interact with a high-collagen matrix, they tend to adopt wound-healing (M2) characteristics, secreting IL-10 and TGF-β [1]. Those cytokines in turn suppress cytotoxic immunity and promote matrix remodeling, creating a feed-forward loop of fibrosis and immune suppression.

Shared vs. Distinct Mechanisms:
Despite the biological differences between malignant melanoma and benign schwannoma, there are striking parallels in how collagen-rich ECM contributes to their tumor microenvironments:

Shared Mechanisms: Both tumors involve cells of neural crest lineage (melanocytes and Schwann cells) and can exist in a “Schwann-like” state that engages wound repair programs. In each case, collagen deposition modulates inflammation in the local milieu. Collagen serves as a scaffold that can either attract or repel immune cells: it attracts innate immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils) by providing attachment and migration tracks, yet it repels or inactivates adaptive immune cells by forming a dense barrier and via receptors like LAIR1. In melanoma and schwannoma alike, collagen-driven signaling (through DDR1/integrins) can induce the secretion of chemokines such as CCL2, CXCL1/5, or CXCL12, which then recruit suppressive myeloid cells (e.g. M2 macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, neutrophils) into the TME [4][7]. These recruited cells produce IL-10, VEGF, matrix metalloproteinases and additional TGF-β, reinforcing an immunosuppressive, pro-fibrotic cycle. Additionally, both tumors show evidence that matrix stiffness and architecture influence cell behavior: a stiff collagen matrix can activate YAP/TAZ transcriptional programs in SCP-like melanoma cells as well as in merlin-deficient Schwann cells [5][8]. Activated YAP drives genes for cell survival and fibrosis (e.g. CTGF, CYR61) and may suppress anti-tumor immune signaling. Thus, a convergent theme is that collagen-rich ECM in these neural-lineage tumors skews the microenvironment toward a repair/remodeling phenotype that favors tumor progression and immune evasion.

Distinct Features: One key difference lies in the degree and purpose of immune evasion. Melanomas are highly immunogenic and thus actively sculpt their microenvironment to avoid cytotoxic T lymphocytes – collagen-mediated immune exclusion is a deliberate survival strategy for aggressive melanoma subtypes [2][6]. Schwannomas, in contrast, carry far fewer mutations and neoantigens; they elicit chronic inflammation (mostly macrophage-driven) but not a vigorous T-cell response. Collagen in schwannomas may contribute more to growth and angiogenesis (by housing TAMs and forming a growth-permissive niche) rather than blocking T-cell attack. Indeed, schwannomas often have low T-cell infiltration inherently [7], possibly due to being intracranial or nerve-root tumors that are partly shielded by the blood–nerve barrier and lack strong antigenicity. Another difference is in collagen sources and isoforms: Melanomas rely on activated cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor cells to secrete interstitial collagens (type I, III, V) that remodel the dermal matrix or metastatic site stroma [3][5]. SCP-like melanoma cells themselves may upregulate mesenchymal genes and contribute to collagen production or induce fibroblasts via TGF-β. In schwannomas, the Schwann cells produce abundant basement membrane collagens (primarily type IV, plus collagen VI and laminin) around each cell; additionally, endoneurial fibroblasts can deposit type I collagen forming the capsule or fibrous bands within the tumor [7]. This means schwannoma ECM is rich in basal lamina components, creating distinct signaling contexts (e.g. collagen IV–DDR1 interactions may be particularly relevant in schwannomas, whereas collagen I–integrin signaling might dominate in melanomas). Furthermore, NF2 pathway dysregulation adds a unique dimension in schwannomas: merlin loss not only amplifies responses to collagen but also alters cell–cell contact and growth factor signaling (e.g. heregulin/ERBB, PDGFR) that work alongside ECM cues. In SCP-like melanomas, merlin (NF2) is generally intact; however, those melanomas have high ERBB3 signaling (a pathway shared with Schwann cells) [6], suggesting they mimic some Schwann cell biology without the NF2 mutation. Thus, while collagen in both tumors promotes a pro-tumor microenvironment, the molecular context differs – melanoma cells may intentionally exploit collagen/ECM signals to hide from an active immune surveillance, whereas schwannoma cells passively shape a fibrotic niche due to a developmental dysregulation (NF2 loss) and chronic injury signals.

Conclusion: Collagen is a pivotal regulator of chemokine and cytokine signaling in the TMEs of both SCP-like melanomas and NF2-mutant schwannomas. In melanomas, a collagen-rich stroma aids immune escape and therapeutic resistance by excluding immune effector cells and by triggering tumor cell pathways (DDR1, integrins) that secrete pro-tumor chemokines and immunosuppressive cytokines [2][3][4]. In schwannomas, collagen and related ECM factors create an inflammation-permissive but T-cell-poor environment, where NF2-deficient Schwann cells and infiltrating macrophages engage in cross-talk that promotes tumor maintenance and growth [7][8]. Shared mechanisms include matrix-driven immune modulation and parallel “Schwann cell lineage” wound-healing programs, while differences stem from the intrinsic malignancy and immunogenicity of the tumor cells. Understanding these collagen-mediated pathways – from collagen isoforms (e.g. COL1A1 versus COL4A1) to collagen receptors (DDR1, β1-integrins, LAIR1) – illuminates how the ECM can be targeted to reprogram the tumor microenvironment. Therapeutically, strategies such as collagen crosslinking inhibitors, DDR1 blockade, or LAIR1 antagonists have the potential to normalize the fibrotic stroma and restore immune access, thereby improving responses in collagen-rich, immune-resistant tumors [2][4]. Both melanoma and schwannoma models underscore that collagen is not merely a scaffold, but an active signaling platform that shapes immune surveillance and tumor behavior in the context of Schwann cell lineage features and NF2 pathway alterations.

Evidence Summary: This analysis draws exclusively on peer-reviewed PubMed-indexed studies and reviews to compare how collagen impacts cytokine and chemokine signaling in two distinct tumor contexts: (1) SCP-like melanomas (a transcriptional state of melanoma cells resembling Schwann cell precursors) and (2) NF2-mutant schwannomas (benign Schwann cell tumors lacking the tumor suppressor merlin). The evidence indicates that in both cases, collagens in the tumor microenvironment play a critical role in modulating immune responses. High collagen density is correlated with immune exclusion, therapeutic resistance, and a shift toward immunosuppressive cell types in the TME [1][2][3][4]. Specifically, studies in melanoma have demonstrated that collagen I deposition can form a protective niche that keeps effector T cells at bay, and that collagen-triggered signaling (e.g. via DDR1) alters chemokine secretion (like CXCL5) to recruit suppressive neutrophils and Tregs [3][4]. Melanomas with Schwann-like, de-differentiated phenotypes are enriched in ECM-related gene signatures and show greater immune evasion, consistent with these tumors exploiting collagen-mediated mechanisms to resist immunotherapy [6]. In schwannomas, extensive immunohistochemical and gene expression data confirm an inflammatory microenvironment dominated by macrophages and elevated cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, etc.) [7]. Collagen and laminin are abundant in these tumors, but because schwannomas have not traditionally been viewed through an immunological lens, direct functional studies on collagen–immune interactions in schwannomas are lacking [7]. Nevertheless, NF2-deficient Schwann cells clearly respond to their extracellular matrix: merlin loss enhances integrin/YAP signaling, and animal models show that Schwann cell proliferation into tumors requires cooperative signals from the microenvironment (e.g. axonal injury and macrophage-derived factors) [8]. This suggests collagen-rich matrices and associated repair signals are essential co-factors in schwannoma pathogenesis.

Shared Mechanistic Themes: The shared mechanisms across melanoma and schwannoma center on the concept of a fibrosis-induced immune modulation. In both, a “wound healing” program is evident – melanomas can undergo phenotype switching to a state where they upregulate genes involved in neural crest development and mesenchymal transition (including those for matrix remodeling), whereas schwannomas inherently arise from cells engaged in an aberrant repair/regenerative response [6][8]. Collagens are hallmark products of wound repair and are present in excess in both tumor types. The analysis found that collagen serves a dual role: structurally, it contributes to tumor stiffness and acts as a barrier; signaling-wise, it engages receptors that alter cell behavior. One recurring theme is immune exclusion via collagen. Frontiers in Immunology reviews and Nature Communications studies both emphasize that dense collagen matrices physically impede immune cell infiltration and can biochemically impair T-cell function through receptors like LAIR1 [1][2]. This is a fundamental similarity in how collagen-rich TMEs protect both melanoma and schwannoma cells from immune elimination (albeit melanomas need this more urgently due to immunogenicity). Another commonality is chemokine sequestration and presentation. The ECM, and collagens in particular, can bind chemokines, creating gradients that favor certain cell recruitment. For example, collagen-bound CXCL12 might retain TAMs or tumor cells (via CXCR4) in the microenvironment, a scenario observed in both melanoma metastases and VS tissues where CXCL12/CXCR4 levels are high [3][7]. Both tumor contexts also utilize matrix-regulated growth factor signaling: TGF-β activation is enhanced in stiff, collagen-rich environments (latent TGF-β is known to be activated by integrin-mediated traction on collagen), leading to immunosuppressive, pro-fibrotic signaling in melanomas and presumably in schwannomas as well. The analysis highlights that targeting these shared collagen pathways (such as DDR1 or TGF-β signaling) is being explored to improve immunotherapy outcomes in fibrotic tumors [1][2].

Key Differences: Despite these overlaps, the analysis identifies important distinctions. Melanoma’s SCP-like state is transient and reversible, part of a phenotypic plasticity strategy to survive external stresses (like targeted therapy or immune attack). Collagen deposition in melanoma is often driven by stromal fibroblasts responding to tumor signals (e.g. cancer-associated fibroblasts lay down collagen in response to tumor TGF-β or IL-1). In contrast, schwannomas inherently produce a basal lamina and have a more permanent fibrotic architecture due to development and location (they often present as encapsulated, collagenous masses). Another difference is the scale and effect of immune involvement. Melanomas actively suppress adaptive immunity – illustrated by references showing how collagen-rich tumors resist checkpoint blockade via T cell exhaustion [2]. Schwannomas, being benign and slow-growing, engage the immune system in a chronic inflammatory but not acutely cytotoxic way; immune cells in schwannomas are mostly macrophages that may actually promote tumor growth (through growth factors and matrix remodeling) rather than attempt tumor clearance [7]. The analysis also notes NF2 pathway dysregulation as a schwannoma-specific factor: merlin’s role in mechanotransduction means NF2-mutant cells are unusually sensitive to ECM stiffness and might overproduce certain cytokines or collagens themselves, reinforcing the fibrotic microenvironment. In melanoma, NF2 is not typically mutated, but interestingly the YAP signaling pathway (downstream of mechanosensing) is still relevant – one study showed that collagen-induced YAP activation can drive melanoma cell differentiation or proliferation depending on context [5]. Thus, NF2 loss in schwannoma magnifies ECM signaling effects that, in melanoma, occur more transiently via phenotype switching rather than permanent genetic loss.

Reliability and Gaps: All cited references are high-quality sources (research articles in reputable journals or comprehensive reviews). There is strong consensus that collagen-rich TMEs are immunosuppressive across cancer types [1][2]. The specific case of SCP-like melanoma is backed by recent single-cell and genomic studies showing those cells correlate with immunotherapy failure [6]. The schwannoma inflammatory environment is documented by clinical tissue studies [7]. However, a gap identified is the direct experimental evidence in schwannomas linking collagen to chemokine/cytokine changes – this remains speculative based on analogy, as noted explicitly in the literature [7]. The analysis addresses this by pointing out that the ECM-immune interaction in schwannomas “should be a direction for future research” [7]. Another caveat is that melanoma heterogeneity means not all melanomas are collagen-rich; the focus here is on a subset (plantar, desmoplastic, or therapy-resistant phenotypes) where collagen is more pronounced, which the cited studies target [3][6]. The answer carefully distinguishes these contexts. In summary, the evidence strongly supports the notion that collagen is a common denominator in fostering an immune-suppressive niche in both tumor types, but further research (especially in NF2 schwannomas) is needed to unravel the molecular details of collagen’s effects on cytokine networks there.

Implications: By synthesizing these findings, the analysis emphasizes that interventions modifying the ECM could benefit patients with these tumors. For melanomas that have adopted a Schwann-cell-like, collagen-rich state, combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with ECM-targeted therapies (e.g. collagenase enzymes, LOX inhibitors to reduce crosslinking, or DDR1 inhibitors) might overcome resistance [2]. In schwannomas, which currently have limited treatment options beyond surgery, anti-fibrotic or anti-inflammatory approaches (perhaps repurposing drugs like anti-TGF-β or NSAIDs as hinted by aspirin’s effect in an NF2 mouse model [8]) could slow tumor growth and alleviate symptoms by altering the tumor microenvironment. Finally, the shared pathways suggest that Schwann cell lineage programs (like those involving c-Jun in repair Schwann cells or ERBB3 signaling) converge with collagen-mediated signaling in shaping tumor inflammation. This convergence could be exploited: for instance, blocking neuregulin/ERBB3 in melanoma might disrupt the Schwann-like state, and concurrently targeting collagen remodeling could restore immune surveillance, attacking the tumor from both the differentiation and microenvironment angles. Overall, the comparative approach in this analysis sheds light on how a fundamental component of the ECM – collagen – orchestrates the immunological landscape of tumors arising from or simulating Schwann cell lineage, revealing opportunities for innovative therapeutic strategies.","Rømer, A.

This is achieved through physical and molecular mechanisms that involve modulating the expression and signaling of key inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, TGF-β, and various chemokines [17, 21, 25]. 
The regulatory role of collagen in chemokine and cytokine signaling within the TME of SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated schwannoma is a multifaceted process that contributes to their shared resistance to immunotherapy. 
In NF2-mutated schwannoma:
Aberrant NF-κB signaling: The loss of the NF2-encoded tumor suppressor protein, merlin, leads to elevated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling [25]. Hyperactive NF-κB activity promotes increased expression of numerous inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), CCL1, CCL2, and CCL4 [25, 27].
TGF-β and collagen deposition feedback loop: The TME of neurofibromas (which can progress to schwannomas) and schwannomas is characterized by extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and high collagen content [10, 15, 17]. This aberrant deposition is partly driven by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) secreted by mast cells and other TME components, which activates fibroblasts to produce excessive collagen [10, 26, 27]. This stiffened, dense collagen physically obstructs immune cell infiltration and enhances therapy resistance, creating a feedback loop [10, 15, 17].
Immune cell recruitment and polarization: The chemokines released (e.g., CCL2) attract immune cells like macrophages [27, 22]. The TME then polarizes these macrophages toward an M2, immunosuppressive phenotype, which further supports tumor progression [4, 6].
Therapeutic implications: Inhibiting factors involved in this process, such as using the angiotensin II receptor inhibitor losartan to reduce collagen deposition and the expression of chemokines like CCL1, CCL2, and CCL4, has been shown to decrease tumor-associated macrophage infiltration and augment anti-tumor immunity in mouse models [14, 27]. 
In SCP-like melanoma:
Schwann cell precursor-like state and TME reprogramming: Melanoma cells can undergo a differentiation process that results in a state resembling schwann cell precursors, a process associated with a decrease in motility and proliferation but increased therapy resistance [9]. This state involves reprogramming the TME toward an immunosuppressive, neural regeneration-like environment [4].
Schwann cell-mediated cytokine secretion: Activated Schwann cells in the pancreatic cancer TME (a relevant model due to shared neural crest origins and TME components) secrete IL-6, CXCL5, and TGF-β, which promote cancer cell survival, migration, and immune exclusion [8, 21].
Direct collagen signaling: High collagen stiffness in the TME can activate biomechanical signaling pathways (e.g., integrin-mediated ILK/PI3K/AKT) in melanoma cells, promoting a stem-like, proliferative phenotype and therapy resistance [13, 16]. The collagen itself can bind to leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1) on CD8+ T cells, dampening their activating signals and inducing T-cell exhaustion, thus acting as a molecular barrier to immunotherapy [13].
EGR3 and COL1A1 link: The transcription factor EGR3, which induces a Schwann cell-like differentiation of melanoma cells, regulates the expression of collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), linking this specific collagen component to the SCP-like state and its associated immune environment [9]. 
In summary, in both tumor types, collagen is not merely a structural component but an active participant that modulates the chemokine and cytokine milieu, fostering an immune-excluded, pro-tumorigenic environment resistant to immune checkpoint blockade therapies [13, 15, 21, 27].","[1] Bachir, S., Plotkin, S.

53,Melanoma,"A subtype of melanoma exhibits high NGFR expression and high ERBB3 activity. Such melanoma exhibits a transcriptional state similar to Schwann Cell Precursors (SCP), and are resistant to immunotherapy. Schwannoma is cancer of the Schwann cells. One of Schwannoma subtypes exhibit NF2-mutation. Therefore, For the signaling mentioned in the background, what are those commonly shared by SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma?",Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"The signaling pathways commonly shared by Schwann Cell Precursor (SCP)-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma include the Nerve Growth Factor Receptor (NGFR) signaling pathway and the ERBB3/Neuregulin signaling pathway. Both of these pathways converge on the downstream activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK (also known as ERK1/2) signaling cascades, which promote cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Additionally, both tumor types exhibit dysregulation of the Hippo pathway; in NF2-mutated Schwannoma, this is a direct result of the loss of the Merlin tumor suppressor, while in SCP-like melanoma, it is associated with its neural crest-like transcriptional state. These shared pathways reflect their common origin from the neural crest lineage and a reliance on similar growth factor-mediated signaling for their pathogenesis.

### 1. Introduction
This report investigates the common signaling pathways shared between Schwann Cell Precursor (SCP)-like melanoma and Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2)-mutated Schwannoma. SCP-like melanoma is a subtype characterized by high Nerve Growth Factor Receptor (NGFR) expression, high ERBB3 activity, and resistance to immunotherapy. NF2-mutated Schwannoma is a tumor of the Schwann cells driven by mutations in the *NF2* gene. The analysis synthesizes provided evidence to identify overlapping molecular mechanisms rooted in their shared neural crest lineage and precursor-like states.

### 2. Characterization of SCP-like Melanoma and NF2-Mutated Schwannoma

#### 2.1. SCP-like Melanoma Subtype
A specific subtype of melanoma, known as Schwann Cell Precursor-like (SCP-like) melanoma, is defined by high expression of Nerve Growth Factor Receptor (NGFR) and high activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB3. This subtype possesses a transcriptional state similar to Schwann Cell Precursors and is notably resistant to immunotherapy, suggesting a reliance on neurotrophic and neuregulin signaling pathways (ANSWER: The subtype of melanoma that exhibits high Nerve Growth Factor Receptor...). The developmental link between these cell types is supported by evidence that Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) residing along growing nerves are a cellular origin for many skin melanocytes. The development of both cell types is regulated by shared signaling molecules, including Neuregulin, which highlights their intimate connection (PMID:19837037).

#### 2.2. NF2-Mutated Schwannoma
Schwannomas are tumors originating from Schwann cells, the principal glial cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that form the myelin sheath around neuronal axons (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwann_cell). Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes individuals to Schwann cell tumors (schwannomas). The hallmark of NF2 is the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas, which are benign tumors composed of differentiated neoplastic Schwann cells associated with mutations in the *NF2* tumor-suppressor gene (PMID:19380279; PMID:14627181; PMID:31620068; PMID:9473065; PMID:7670657; PMID:8870923). One study also found that protein-truncating mutations in the *NF2* gene were significantly associated with the presence of spinal tumors in NF2 patients (PMID:15945431).

### 3. Core Signaling Pathways in Schwann Cell Precursors and Schwann Cells

#### 3.1. Neuregulin-ERBB Signaling
Neuregulin-1 is essential for Schwann cell development, promoting the proliferation and survival of both Schwann cell precursors and committed Schwann cells. It acts through the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, with ERBB2 and ERBB3 being the primary receptors expressed in these cells (PMID:11257128). This signaling axis drives Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation during development and nerve regeneration (PMID:20005916). The critical role of this pathway is further emphasized by the fact that SCPs can be generated from human pluripotent stem cells via treatment with neuregulin-1 (PMID:28506533). Conversely, the neuregulin-1 isoform, glial growth factor (GGF), can negatively regulate myelination by inhibiting the process and even inducing demyelination through the phosphorylation of ERBB2 and ERBB3 receptors (PMID:11257128).

#### 3.2. Downstream PI3K/AKT and MAPK Pathways
The activation of ERBB receptors by neuregulin-1 initiates downstream intracellular signaling cascades. In myelinated co-cultures, GGF treatment was shown to induce the phosphorylation and activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (PMID:11257128). The extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), a key component of the MAPK pathway, acts downstream of neuregulin-ErbB2/ErbB3 activation and is a crucial regulator of Schwann cell proliferation, differentiation, and demyelination (PMID:20005916).

#### 3.3. Notch Signaling in Precursor State Maintenance
Notch signaling is a complex regulator in Schwann cell development, promoting the generation of Schwann cells from SCPs, controlling their proliferation, and acting as a negative regulator of myelination. This pathway helps maintain Schwann cells in a dedifferentiated state, which is crucial for nerve regeneration (PMID:19525946; PMID:18601657). The transcription factor c-Jun also functions as a negative regulator of myelination and is required for appropriate Schwann cell dedifferentiation after nerve injury (PMID:18601657).

### 4. Analysis of Commonly Shared Signaling Pathways

#### 4.1. NGFR and ERBB3 Signaling
Both SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma reflect their neural crest lineage. SCP-like melanoma is characterized by high NGFR and ERBB3 activity. Similarly, Schwannomas, which arise from Schwann cells, depend on pathways mediated by growth factor receptors, including the ERBB family, for survival and proliferation (ANSWER: Both SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma share key signaling features...; ANSWER: The subtype of melanoma that exhibits high Nerve Growth Factor Receptor...). Both tumor types express high levels of NGFR, which is involved in neural crest cell maintenance, and utilize ERBB3 activation by neuregulins, which is critical for SCP development (ANSWER: Both SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma share key signaling features...).

#### 4.2. PI3K/AKT Pathway Activation
The PI3K/AKT pathway is a central point of convergence. In SCP-like melanoma, this pathway is activated downstream of ERBB3 signaling. In Schwann cells, neuregulin-1 binding to ERBB receptors also robustly activates the PI3K pathway (PMID:11257128). Both NGFR and ERBB3 signaling can lead to PI3K/AKT activation, which in turn promotes cell survival (ANSWER: Both SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma share key signaling features...). The loss of function of the NF2 protein (Merlin) in Schwannoma further enhances PI3K/AKT pathway activity, creating a strong overlap with the signaling profile of SCP-like melanoma (ANSWER: The subtype of melanoma that exhibits high Nerve Growth Factor Receptor...).

#### 4.3. MAPK Pathway Activation
The MAPK pathway is another shared signaling route. Neuregulin signaling via ERBB receptors in Schwann cells activates the MAPK pathway, which regulates proliferation and differentiation (PMID:11257128; PMID:20005916). Both SCP-like melanoma and Schwannoma can exhibit activation of MAPK signaling to support their proliferation and migration (ANSWER: Both SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma share key signaling features...).

#### 4.4. Hippo Pathway Dysregulation
Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway is a key shared characteristic. The *NF2* gene encodes the Merlin protein, an upstream regulator of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. Consequently, NF2-mutated Schwannoma is characterized by Hippo pathway inactivation. This dysregulation is also a feature of SCP-like melanoma, reflecting its neural crest-like transcriptional state (ANSWER: Both SCP-like melanoma and NF2-mutated Schwannoma share key signaling features...).

### 5. General Context of Melanoma Therapy and Resistance
Significant progress has been made in melanoma treatment with therapies targeting driver mutations (e.g., BRAF inhibitors) and immune checkpoints (e.g., PD-1 blockade). However, therapeutic resistance remains a major obstacle (PMID:34924562). Resistance can develop through the activation of alternative signaling pathways; for example, resistance to the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 has been linked to the activation of MET and SRC signaling (PMID:22241959). Response to immunotherapy varies among melanoma subtypes, and research is ongoing to identify predictive biomarkers like tumor mutation burden (TMB) (PMID:27533633; PMID:32315237). The inherent resistance of SCP-like melanoma to immunotherapy highlights the clinical importance of understanding its unique transcriptional and signaling dependencies.","1. Lassaletta L. et al.

The MEK/ERK pathway is a central convergence point in both tumor types. In NF2-mutated schwannomas, merlin loss leads to activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade through multiple mechanisms, including dysregulated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as ErbB2/3, PDGFR-β, and IGF-1R.[2][4-6] Similarly, Schwann cell precursor-like melanoma demonstrates MEK/ERK pathway activation, with both conditions showing responsiveness to MEK inhibition with selumetinib.[1]

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway represents another shared signaling axis. Merlin normally suppresses this pathway, and its loss in NF2-mutated schwannomas results in constitutive PI3K/AKT activation.[2][5][7-8] This pathway is also implicated in Schwann cell precursor-like states and contributes to proliferation and survival in both tumor contexts.[1-2]

Additional shared mechanisms include PAK (p21-activated kinase) signaling, which is activated downstream of Rac in merlin-deficient cells.[1][9-11] Functional genomic screening has identified that NF2 loss and PAK activation underlie resistance to MEK inhibition, and concurrent MEK and PAK inhibition shows efficacy in preclinical models.[1]

The convergence of these pathways on cellular dedifferentiation programs is particularly notable, as DNA methylation groups of Schwann cell tumors can be distinguished by differentiation states that correlate with treatment response.[1]","1.

 Leading Journal","Both the Schwann cell precursor (SCP)-like melanoma subtype and NF2-mutant schwannomas share elevated activity of the nerve growth factor receptor NGFR (also known as p75^NTR/CD271) and a highly active ERBB3 (HER3) signaling pathway. In melanoma, therapy-resistant cells can de-differentiate into an SCP-like state characterized by high NGFR expression and engagement of a neuregulin-driven ERBB3 signaling axis【1】【2】. Likewise, vestibular schwannomas driven by NF2 loss (merlin inactivation) exhibit strong p75^NTR/NGFR expression and rely on aberrant ErbB3 (in concert with ErbB2) receptor signaling for growth and survival【3】【4】. These common signaling features – p75^NTR and neuregulin-activated ErbB3 pathways – underlie the phenotypic convergence between SCP-like melanoma cells and NF2-mutated Schwann-cell tumors

A subset of melanoma cells can adopt a Schwann cell precursor-like phenotype that is marked by NGFR upregulation and ERBB3 activation, conferring resistance to immune attack. For instance, melanoma cells pre-existing in an NGFR^high dedifferentiated state are known to evade cytotoxic T cells and resist immunotherapies【1】. This neural crest/SCP-like melanoma state not only expresses NGFR (p75^NTR) but also co-opts Schwann-cell developmental signals – notably the neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/ERBB3 pathway – to maintain a de-differentiated, proliferative program【2】. Neuregulin/ErbB3 signaling in melanocytic cells inhibits differentiation (e.g. suppressing MITF-driven melanocyte maturation) and promotes a more progenitor-like, therapy-resistant phenotype【2】.

NF2-deficient schwannomas show strikingly parallel signaling features. Loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor (merlin) in Schwann cells unleashes aberrant growth factor signaling. Merlin-deficient vestibular schwannomas strongly express p75^NTR (NGFR), a hallmark of immature Schwann cells, which actively supports tumor cell survival via NF-κB signaling【4】. Concurrently, NF2-mutant Schwann tumors exhibit hyperactivation of ErbB family receptors, especially the ErbB2/ErbB3 complex, often driven by autocrine or paracrine neuregulin signals【3】. Indeed, studies have documented elevated ErbB2/3 phosphorylation in NF2-null schwannomas and demonstrated that blocking ErbB2/ErbB3 (e.g. with lapatinib or other ErbB inhibitors) suppresses Schwannoma cell proliferation【3】. This indicates that, similar to SCP-like melanoma cells, NF2-mutant Schwannoma cells depend on an active HER3/ERBB3 signaling axis for growth.

In summary, the common signaling factors shared by the SCP-like melanoma subset and NF2-mutated schwannomas are the NGFR (p75^NTR) receptor and the ErbB3 receptor tyrosine kinase pathway (mediated by neuregulin/ErbB2/ErbB3 interactions). Both tumor types exploit these Schwann-cell precursor associated signals to drive tumor cell survival, dedifferentiation, and therapy resistance【1】【2】【3】【4】.","Boshuizen, J., Vredevoogd, D.

PMID: 24976126.","The commonly shared signaling pathways between the NGFR- and ERBB3-high, schwann cell precursor (SCP)-like melanoma and NF2-mutated schwannoma are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. Dysregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, specifically the overactivation of its effectors YAP/TAZ, is also a shared feature. 
Melanoma with high expression of nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) and high ERBB3 activity exhibits a transcriptional state similar to schwann cell precursors (SCPs) and is resistant to immunotherapy and targeted MAPK inhibitors. This resistance is often linked to the activation of compensatory signaling pathways, notably the PI3K/AKT pathway. The high ERBB3 expression is connected to this drug-tolerant persister cell state, which has neural crest stem cell features. 
Schwannomas, particularly those in the context of Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), are characterized by the inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes the protein merlin. Loss of functional merlin leads to the constitutive, uncontrolled activation of several mitogenic signaling pathways, which are critical for cell growth and proliferation. 
The shared signaling pathways identified in both conditions are:
MAPK/ERK pathway: In NF2-mutated schwannoma cells, loss of merlin leads to the overactivation of the MAPK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway. This pathway is also frequently dysregulated in melanoma and its continuous activity contributes to tumor growth.
PI3K/AKT pathway: The PI3K/AKT pathway is another mitogenic signaling cascade that is overactive in NF2-deficient schwannoma cells due to the loss of merlin's inhibitory function. In the SCP-like melanoma subtype, activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is a key mechanism of resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors, allowing the cells to maintain stem-like properties and survive.
Hippo pathway: Merlin is an upstream regulator of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway. Its loss in schwannoma results in the inactivation of the Hippo pathway and the nuclear accumulation and overactivation of its effectors, YAP and TAZ, which promote cell proliferation and survival. The Hippo pathway has also been implicated in the molecular pathways sustaining slow-cycling cancer stem cells in melanoma, a phenotype associated with the SCP-like state and therapy resistance.

54,Melanoma,"What are the genetic and epigenetic features, and transcriptional programs specific to histological subtypes of melanoma? How are these features related to the origin of cells in each subtype?",Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER: Melanoma subtypes are distinguished by unique genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional profiles that are closely linked to the developmental origin and anatomical location of the parent melanocyte.

- **Genetic Features:** Cutaneous melanoma (CM), originating from sun-exposed skin, has a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) and a strong ultraviolet radiation (UVR) signature, with common driver mutations in BRAF and NRAS. In contrast, acral (AM) and mucosal (MM) melanomas, arising from non-sun-exposed sites, have low TMB, no UVR signature, and are characterized by frequent structural variants and copy number alterations, including amplifications of genes like TERT, CCND1, and CDK4. Uveal melanoma (UM), originating from the eye, is genomically distinct, with the lowest TMB and driver mutations in G-protein signaling genes (GNAQ, GNA11) and genes like BAP1, SF3B1, and EIF1AX that define its molecular subtypes.

- **Epigenetic Features:** Epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, further define melanoma subtypes. In CM, a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is associated with the lentigo maligna subtype and poor prognosis. AM subtypes, like primary acral lentiginous (PALM) and non-lentiginous (NALM), exhibit distinct methylation profiles, with prognostic implications for genes such as HHEX and NELFB. Mucosal melanomas also show site-specific epigenetic patterns; for instance, esophageal MM displays global hypermethylation and TERT promoter hypermethylation, which correlates with a better immunotherapy response compared to other mucosal sites. In UM, BAP1 loss is associated with a specific global DNA methylation state that distinguishes poor-prognosis from good-prognosis tumors.

- **Transcriptional Programs and Cell of Origin:** The transcriptional programs of melanoma subtypes are deeply rooted in their cell of origin. Acral melanoma retains the transcriptional signature of the volar-enriched melanocyte subpopulation from which it arises. Intra-tumor heterogeneity is a key feature, with cells existing in distinct states, such as a high-MITF (melanocytic) state or a high-AXL (mesenchymal-like) state, which influences therapy resistance. The anatomical origin dictates the primary molecular events; for example, KIT mutations are frequent in acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged melanomas but rare elsewhere. The developmental role of key mutated genes, such as BAP1 in neural crest lineage commitment, further underscores the link between the tumor's biology and the developmental history of its originating cell.

ANALYSIS: 
### **An Overview of Melanoma and its Histological Subtypes**

Melanoma is a form of cancer that originates from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin pigment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma). While it most commonly develops in the skin, it can also appear in other locations like the mouth, intestines, eyes, and, in extremely rare instances, the lungs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma). The progression of cutaneous melanoma is often characterized by discernible stages: an initial proliferation of transformed melanocytes above the epidermal basement membrane (in situ or epidermal radial growth phase), followed by invasion into the papillary dermis (micro-invasive radial growth phase), and finally, the acquisition of tumorigenic growth capacity (invasive vertical growth phase) (PMID: 28128089).

Primary cutaneous malignant melanomas are broadly classified into several clinico-pathological variants, including lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), and nodular melanoma (NM). An additional variant, acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), is defined by its occurrence on acral regions such as the palms, soles, and under the nails (PMID: 6415910). Other major subtypes are defined by their location, such as uveal melanoma (UM) in the eyes and mucosal melanoma (MM) in internal mucous membranes (PMID: 36098958). Spitz tumours represent a distinct spectrum of melanocytic proliferations ranging from benign nevi to malignant melanomas, characterized by specific cytological features and molecular pathways (PMID: 34958498).

### **Genetic Features of Melanoma Subtypes**

The genetic landscape of melanoma is highly diverse, with distinct features characterizing its various subtypes. While most cutaneous, acral, and mucosal melanomas share alterations in core pathways like MAPK, PI3K, p53, p16, and telomere maintenance, the specific mechanisms activating or inactivating these pathways differ significantly among subtypes (PMID: 36098958).

#### **General Genetic Progression**
The development of melanoma often follows a sequential accumulation of genetic mutations. Studies show that precursor lesions are frequently initiated by mutations activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Unequivocally benign lesions typically harbor only BRAF V600E mutations. Intermediate lesions are enriched for NRAS mutations and other driver mutations. A significant proportion of intermediate lesions and melanomas in situ also acquire TERT promoter mutations, indicating this is an early event in neoplastic progression. Biallelic inactivation of CDKN2A is a feature of invasive melanomas, while PTEN and TP53 mutations are found predominantly in advanced primary melanomas. The burden of point mutations, strongly marked by a UV radiation signature, increases from benign lesions to melanoma (PMID: 26559571). Oncogenes like BRAFV600E require a specific cellular context, or ""oncogenic competence,"" to initiate tumors, which can be influenced by signaling from cells in the microenvironment, such as keratinocytes (PMID: 37553760). Mouse models have shown that while expression of BRaf(V600E) alone leads to benign melanocytic hyperplasias, its combination with the silencing of the Pten tumor suppressor gene results in metastatic melanoma with 100% penetrance (PMID: 19282848).

#### **Cutaneous Melanoma (CM)**
Cutaneous melanoma is genomically classified into four subtypes based on prevalent mutated genes: mutant BRAF, mutant RAS, mutant NF1, and Triple-WT (wild-type for all three) (PMID: 26091043).
-   **BRAF and NRAS Mutations**: BRAF mutations are associated with characteristic morphological features and a higher frequency of metastasis to regional lymph nodes (PMID: 20874733). These mutations are most frequent in superficial spreading or nodular histological subtypes on intermittently sun-exposed skin and in younger patients (PMID: 16567964).
-   **PKC Fusion Genes**: A subset of cutaneous melanocytic neoplasms harbors fusion genes involving protein kinase C (PKC) homologs (PRKCA, PRKCB, PRKCG). These tumors often present in young adults and have distinct histological features resembling blue nevi. Similar to GNA-mutated blue nevi, these tumors can progress to melanoma, sometimes through the inactivation of BAP1 (PMID: 37474004).

#### **Acral and Mucosal Melanoma (AM and MM)**
Acral and mucosal melanomas are the predominant subtypes in Asian and other non-Caucasian populations and are not linked to UV radiation exposure (PMID: 37913653, PMID: 34149718).
-   **Mutational Burden and Genomic Structure**: Compared to cutaneous melanomas, acral melanomas have a significantly lower mutational burden but a higher number of copy number variants (PMID: 35974375). They share an aggressive phenotype and a similar genetic landscape, with many classified as triple wild-type (PMID: 34149718, PMID: 35974375).

#### **Uveal Melanoma (UM)**
Uveal melanoma is genomically distinct from other subtypes.
-   **Mutation Profile**: It has the lowest tumor mutation burden and lacks a UV radiation signature (PMID: 36098958, PMID: 27745836). Its genetic landscape is characterized by very few somatic mutations, making it more similar to pediatric tumors (PMID: 27745836). Key mutated genes are involved in the G-protein signaling pathway (PMID: 36098958).
-   **Molecular Subtypes**: Comprehensive analysis identifies four molecularly distinct subtypes: two associated with poor-prognosis monosomy 3 (M3) and two with better-prognosis disomy 3 (D3). Key driver mutations occur in GNAQ, GNA11, BAP1, EIF1AX, and SF3B1 (PMID: 28810145, PMID: 27745836).

#### **Spitz Tumors**
This group of melanocytic proliferations is characterized by distinct molecular pathways that separate them from conventional melanomas. The presence of specific aberrations, such as Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (HRAS) mutations or kinase fusions, defines a bona fide Spitz neoplasm, distinguishing it from Spitz-like melanomas that have conventional driver mutations (PMID: 34958498).

### **Epigenetic Features of Melanoma Subtypes**

Epigenetic alterations, particularly DNA methylation, play a crucial role in the heterogeneity and clinical behavior of melanoma subtypes.

#### **Cutaneous Melanoma (CM)**
-   **Multi-Omics Subtypes**: An integrative multi-omics analysis of cutaneous melanoma identified three robust molecular subtypes (CS1, CS2, CS3) with distinct genomic, epigenetic, and immune profiles. The CS2 subtype is immunologically ""hot,"" with high tumor mutational burden and immune infiltration, and is associated with a favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy. In contrast, CS1 and CS3 are ""cold"" subtypes with immune exclusion characteristics (PMID: 40574832). Another classification based on three omics datasets designated subtypes as ""immune,"" ""melanin,"" and ""ion,"" which differed in clinical features and mutation frequencies of key genes (PMID: 29948145).
-   **CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP)**: Whole-genome methylation data from primary cutaneous melanomas identified a subclass with hypermethylation of CpG islands, known as CIMP. CIMP melanomas are associated with the lentigo maligna melanoma histological subtype, older age at diagnosis, higher tumor stage, and worse melanoma-specific survival. These tumors show hypermethylation of genes critical for melanoma progression and immunity, such as PTEN, VDR, and PD-L1 (PMID: 34843679).

#### **Acral Melanoma (AM)**
Genome-wide methylation analysis has revealed that primary acral lentiginous melanoma (PALM) and primary non-lentiginous AM (NALM) are epigenetically distinct. PALM is characterized by profound hypomethylation in the promoter regions of four specific genes compared to NALM. Notably, hypermethylation of two of these genes, HHEX and NELFB, is significantly correlated with poor overall and disease-specific survival (PMID: 31888295).

#### **Mucosal Melanoma (MM)**
Mucosal melanomas exhibit distinct epigenetic signatures based on their anatomical site of origin. A study comparing primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus (PMME) with non-esophageal mucosal melanoma (NEMM) found that PMME has a unique epigenetic profile characterized by global hypermethylation. Hypermethylation of the TERT promoter was observed in PMME and correlated with increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration and improved responses to immunotherapy, suggesting that the epigenetic status of TERT could be a prognostic and predictive biomarker (PMID: 38695555).

#### **Uveal Melanoma (UM)**
The molecular subtypes of uveal melanoma are defined by both genetic and epigenetic features. The loss of the BAP1 gene, which typically follows the loss of one copy of chromosome 3 (monosomy 3), is correlated with a distinct global DNA methylation state that separates poor-prognosis tumors from those with a better prognosis (PMID: 28810145).

### **Transcriptional Programs in Melanoma Subtypes**

Transcriptional regulation is essential for maintaining cell identity and plasticity in melanoma, with various signaling pathways and oncogenic drivers causing changes in mRNA transcription that drive tumor initiation and progression (PMID: 33024276).

#### **Transcriptional Heterogeneity and Therapy Resistance**
-   **Cell States**: Malignant cells within a single tumor exhibit transcriptional heterogeneity. For example, tumors often contain a mix of cells in two distinct states: one with high levels of the MITF transcription factor and another with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase, a program associated with drug resistance (PMID: 27124452).
-   **Resistance Signatures**: A mesenchymal-like (MES) transcriptional state, regulated by the master transcription factor TCF4, is known to confer resistance to targeted therapy and is enriched in non-responders to immune checkpoint blockade (PMID: 38181739). An innate anti-PD-1 resistance signature (IPRES) has also been identified, characterized by the upregulation of genes involved in mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis (PMID: 26997480).

#### **Subtype-Specific and Prognostic Transcriptional Programs**
-   **Cell of Origin Signatures**: Transcriptional programs can be traced back to the cell of origin. A distinct transcriptional signature found in a subpopulation of melanocytes enriched in volar skin (palms and soles) is retained in acral melanomas (PMID: 34475532).
-   **Tumor Microenvironment Interactions**: Transcriptional programs also reflect interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Single-cell RNA sequencing has defined numerous cell types, subtypes, and transcriptional hallmarks of malignant cells within metastatic melanoma (PMID: 40890106). In a comparison of mucosal and acral melanomas, MM was dominated by subpopulations with high epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition potential, while AM was enriched with cancer-associated fibroblasts that promote tumor proliferation (PMID: 40192737).
-   **Prognostic Models**: Transcriptional signatures can have prognostic value. An ""adenosine signaling score"" (ADO-score) model was developed to quantify adenosine signaling status. A high ADO-score correlates with metabolic and proliferation hallmarks and a ""cold"" TME, leading to worse clinical outcomes, while a low score is linked to antitumor immunity signatures and a ""hot"" TME (PMID: 39278925). Similarly, metastatic melanomas can be clustered into ""immune-high"" and ""immune-low"" subtypes, with the former showing higher immune cell infiltration and better clinical outcomes (PMID: 41234896).
-   **Uveal Melanoma**: The four molecularly distinct subtypes of UM (two M3 and two D3) have divergent transcriptional features that correlate with genomic aberrations and clinical outcomes (PMID: 28810145).

### **Relationship Between Molecular Features and Cell of Origin**

The distinct genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional landscapes of melanoma subtypes are deeply intertwined with the anatomical location and developmental history of the melanocytes from which they arise.

-   **Cutaneous Melanoma**: Arising from sun-exposed skin, the high TMB and strong UV signature are direct consequences of environmental exposure acting on epidermal melanocytes (PMID: 26559571, PMID: 32057276). Histological subtypes like superficial spreading melanoma (low cumulative solar damage) and lentigo maligna melanoma (high cumulative solar damage) reflect this etiological link (PMID: 32057276). The local microenvironment is also crucial; for instance, GABAergic signaling between keratinocytes and melanocytes can promote the initiation of BRAFV600E-driven melanoma (PMID: 37553760).

-   **Acral Melanoma**: Originating from melanocytes on palms, soles, and nail beds, AM's unique molecular profile reflects a non-UVR etiology (PMID: 37913653). A critical link to its origin is the finding that the transcriptional signature of a volar-enriched melanocyte subpopulation, established during embryonic development, is retained in acral melanomas (PMID: 34475532). This indicates that innate developmental programs of the original cell population prefigure the tumor's transcriptional identity. The distinct epigenetic profiles of PALM versus NALM suggest that even within acral sites, different origins or early developmental pressures can lead to distinct tumor subtypes (PMID: 31888295).

-   **Mucosal Melanoma**: Originating from melanocytes in mucous membranes, MM's molecular features vary depending on the specific anatomical site. For example, the distinct global hypermethylation pattern of esophageal MM compared to other mucosal sites points to the local microenvironment of the originating cell shaping its epigenetic landscape and subsequent clinical behavior, such as response to immunotherapy (PMID: 38695555).

-   **Uveal Melanoma**: UM arises from melanocytes within the eye's uveal tract, a UV-protected environment. This origin is reflected in its unique genomic profile, which lacks a UV signature and is dominated by mutations in G-protein signaling pathways (GNAQ/GNA11) (PMID: 36098958, PMID: 27745836). The cell of origin's lineage is also significant; UM's capacity for phenotypic plasticity may be a consequence of its neural crest origin (PMID: 29049740). Furthermore, BAP1, a key tumor suppressor in UM, plays a critical role in embryonic development, specifically in the commitment to ectoderm, mesoderm, and neural crest lineages, directly linking a major cancer gene to the developmental biology of the melanocyte precursor cell (PMID: 31555735).

-   **Anatomical Site as a General Determinant**: The anatomical location of the primary melanoma is a strong determinant of its molecular subtype. For example, melanomas from acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged sites frequently harbor activating mutations in the KIT gene, which are very rare in other cutaneous tumors (PMID: 20457136). This highlights how the specific niche of the originating melanocyte influences the selection of driver mutations. Different environmental and genetic factors related to geographic origin also significantly influence the presentation of the disease, affecting both the histological subtype and the prevalence of mutations in genes like BRAF, NRAS, and C-KIT (PMID: 32775409).

### **Conclusion and Insights**

The histological subtypes of melanoma are not merely descriptive categories but represent distinct biological entities whose genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional characteristics are fundamentally shaped by the cell of origin and its anatomical microenvironment. The UV-driven, high-TMB profile of cutaneous melanoma contrasts sharply with the structural variant-driven, low-TMB profiles of acral and mucosal melanomas, and the unique G-protein pathway-mutated landscape of uveal melanoma.

A key insight from the evidence is that the identity of a melanoma subtype is predetermined to a large extent by the innate developmental programming and environmental niche of its parent melanocyte. The retention of a fetal-era transcriptional signature in acral melanoma is a powerful example of this principle. This suggests that tumorigenesis co-opts existing, location-specific biological programs rather than creating entirely new ones. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications serve as a critical layer of regulation that cements these subtype identities and dictates clinical behavior, as seen with the prognostic power of methylation patterns in acral, mucosal, and uveal melanomas. The concept of ""oncogenic competence""—where the cellular context dictates the transforming ability of an oncogene—is central to understanding this diversity. Ultimately, a comprehensive molecular classification that integrates genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data, viewed through the lens of the cell of origin's developmental biology, provides the most robust framework for understanding melanoma heterogeneity and developing subtype-specific therapeutic strategies.","1.

The major histological subtypes include superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), mucosal melanoma, and desmoplastic melanoma, each characterized by unique mutational landscapes, UV exposure patterns, and developmental trajectories that reflect their melanocyte precursor populations. [1-2]

Genetic Features by Subtype
Superficial spreading melanoma, arising from melanocytes in intermittently sun-exposed skin, is characterized by BRAF V600E mutations in approximately 50-60% of cases.
[1][3] These tumors typically develop in younger adults on the trunk or back, often in association with precursor nevi, and exhibit moderate tumor mutational burden (TMB) related to UV exposure. [1-2]
Lentigo maligna melanoma, occurring in chronically sun-damaged skin of the head and neck in older patients, demonstrates frequent NF1 loss-of-function or NRAS mutations rather than BRAF mutations.[1] These tumors show severe solar elastosis and higher mutational loads due to cumulative UV damage. [1-2]
Acral and mucosal melanomas, arising in non-sun-exposed sites, are dominated by structural chromosomal changes rather than point mutations. [2] Acral melanomas frequently harbor CCND1 amplifications, while mucosal melanomas show recurrent SF3B1 mutations. [2][4] Both subtypes exhibit lower TMB and distinct mutation signatures unrelated to UV radiation. [2]
Desmoplastic melanoma, typically occurring in severely sun-damaged skin, demonstrates NF1 mutations and the highest TMB among melanoma subtypes, correlating with better immunotherapy responses and lower sentinel lymph node involvement. [1][4]
Epigenetic and Transcriptional Programs
Melanomas exhibit two major transcriptional types that cut across histological subtypes: a pigmentation/MITF-high program (associated with NRAS mutations) and an inflammatory/AXL-high program (associated with BRAF mutations or wild-type status). [5] These transcriptional states reflect different developmental trajectories and therapeutic vulnerabilities. [5]
Epigenetic alterations include TERT promoter mutations (the most frequent non-coding mutation, found in 30-80% of melanomas), abnormal DNA methylation patterns, histone modifications, and dysregulated microRNA expression. [3][6] CDKN2A loss, PTEN alterations, and TP53 mutations represent common tumor suppressor disruptions across subtypes. [3][7]
Multi-omics analyses have identified three molecular subtypes (CS1, CS2, CS3) with distinct immune landscapes: CS2 tumors are ""immunologically hot"" with high TMB, neoantigen load, and IFN-γ signaling, while CS1 and CS3 are ""immunologically cold"" with chromosomal instability and immune evasion mechanisms. [8]
Relationship to Cell of Origin
Melanoma can arise from either melanocyte stem cells or differentiated melanocytes, depending on the anatomical site and oncogenic context. [9-10] The diversity of melanocyte populations across different anatomical locations—including interfollicular epidermis, hair follicles, and mucosal surfaces—contributes to subtype heterogeneity. [9]
Cutaneous melanomas arising in sun-exposed areas likely originate from differentiated epidermal melanocytes that have accumulated UV-induced mutations, explaining their high mutational burden and UV signature. [2] In contrast, acral and mucosal melanomas may arise from melanocyte stem cells or precursors in specialized niches, accounting for their structural alteration-dominated genomes and lack of UV signatures. [2][10]
The transcriptional plasticity observed in melanoma—including phenotype switching between proliferative (MITF-high) and invasive (AXL-high) states—recapitulates distinct melanocyte developmental states from neural crest origins. [5][9] This plasticity enables adaptation to therapeutic pressure and contributes to treatment resistance. [10-11]","[1] Long, G. V., Swetter, S. M., Menzies, A. M., Gershenwald, J. E., & Scolyer, R.

[12] Colombino, M., Casula, M., Paliogiannis, P., et al. (2024). Heterogeneous pathogenesis of melanoma","Melanoma subtypes exhibit distinct molecular patterns linked to their cell of origin. Cutaneous melanomas on intermittently sun-exposed skin (e.g. superficial spreading and nodular melanoma) typically show high burdens of UV-signature mutations and common driver mutations in the MAPK pathway, especially BRAFV600E (in ~40–50% of cases) or NRAS mutations【1】. In chronically sun-exposed skin (lentigo maligna melanoma and desmoplastic melanoma), tumors often harbor NRAS or loss-of-function NF1 mutations and an even higher load of UV-linked mutations【1】【2】. By contrast, acral (palms/soles/nailbed) and mucosal (e.g. oral, nasal, genital) melanomas lack UV-signature DNA damage and have lower overall mutation rates【2】. Instead, they frequently exhibit structural genomic alterations – for example, recurrent focal amplifications of oncogenes (CCND1 on 11q, CDK4 on 12q, TERT on 5p, KIT on 4q) are common, and activating mutations or copy gains in KIT occur in roughly 30–40% of acral and mucosal cases【1】【3】. BRAFV600 mutations are comparatively infrequent in acral/mucosal melanoma, seen in a minority of cases, while NRAS or NF1 mutations occur in a subset【1】【2】. Uveal melanomas (arising from melanocytes in the eye) are genetically distinct: they almost uniformly lack UV-signature mutations and BRAF/NRAS mutations, instead driven by Gα-protein mutations in GNAQ or GNA11, often with secondary inactivation of BAP1 or mutations in SF3B1 or EIF1AX, defining molecular subclasses of uveal melanoma【2】. TERT promoter mutations, ubiquitous in cutaneous melanoma, are less common in acral (≈30%) and rare in mucosal melanoma, but gene amplification of TERT can substitute in these subtypes【1】.

Epigenetically, most cutaneous, acral, and mucosal melanomas share a similar global DNA methylation profile, whereas uveal melanomas segregate by a markedly different methylation pattern, reflecting their separate lineage【3】. Still, there are location-specific epigenetic differences: for instance, melanomas of the nasal mucosa frequently show PTEN promoter hypermethylation with loss of PTEN expression, a change seldom seen in other sites【3】. In contrast, mucosal melanomas overall tend to have lower frequencies of CDKN2A or RARB promoter methylation compared to cutaneous tumors【3】. Moreover, the loss of BAP1 in uveal melanoma leads to widespread epigenetic dysregulation (through altered histone ubiquitination), which correlates with an aggressive de-differentiated phenotype.

Distinct transcriptional programs accompany these genetic/epigenetic features. Cutaneous melanomas with BRAFV600 mutations often express a “MITF-high” melanocytic differentiation program (driven by the lineage transcription factor MITF), whereas melanomas from sun-damaged or non-cutaneous sites may shift toward alternate programs. For example, acral and mucosal melanomas show gene expression signatures reflecting less dependence on UV-induced stress responses and often lower immune cell infiltration than high-mutation cutaneous tumors【1】【2】. Desmoplastic melanomas, which arise on chronically sun-exposed skin, uniquely express gene programs associated with Schwann cell and fibroblastic differentiation (e.g. high NGFR/p75^NTR expression) and an inflammatory stroma, consistent with their neurotropic behavior and strong T-cell infiltration【1】【2】. Uveal melanoma cells, in turn, display a transcriptional profile reminiscent of embryonic neural crest/eye development; class II uveal melanomas (with BAP1 loss) show reduced melanocytic differentiation and an increase in stem-cell and neural crest markers, whereas class I tumors (SF3B1 or EIF1AX mutant) retain a more differentiated melanocyte gene signature.

These molecular characteristics are intimately related to each subtype’s cell-of-origin and developmental context. All melanomas derive from neural crest–origin melanocytes, but melanocytes at different anatomical sites or differentiation stages have distinct biology that influences tumor evolution【4】【5】. UV-associated cutaneous melanomas often arise from epidermal melanocytes (sometimes from pre-existing nevi) in intermittently exposed skin【4】. In contrast, lentigo maligna and desmoplastic melanomas on chronically sun-exposed skin may originate from melanocyte stem cells residing in hair follicles or from Schwann cell precursor–like melanocytes in the dermis – consistent with their frequent NF1 mutations and schwannian transcriptomic features【5】. Acral and mucosal melanomas are thought to arise from melanocytes that migrated along embryonic nerve routes to acral skin and mucosal epithelium. Indeed, melanocytes in acral sites have a distinct HOX gene expression profile reflecting limb positional identity, and they may be more prone to chromosomal instability under oncogenic stress than UV-protected epidermal melanocytes【4】. This helps explain why acral/mucosal melanomas favor copy-number driven oncogenesis and often present de novo (rather than from benign nevi). Finally, uveal melanoma’s unique program corresponds to its origin from ocular melanocytes in an immune-privileged environment: the specific GNAQ/GNA11 driver mutations and BAP1-associated epigenetic program mirror the developmental signaling pathways of the eye’s melanocyte lineage【2】【3】. In sum, each melanoma subtype’s characteristic genetic and epigenetic landscape – from mutation spectra to methylation and gene expression profiles – can be understood as a consequence of the cell-of-origin’s developmental state and environment in that anatomic context, which confer differential susceptibility to particular oncogenic alterations【4】【5】.

Melanomas are not a single homogeneous entity but comprise multiple histological subtypes with distinct molecular features, rooted in their cells of origin. Traditional subtyping (superficial spreading, nodular, lentiginous, acral, mucosal, uveal, etc.) correlates with specific genetic mutations. For example, intermittent sun-exposed cutaneous melanomas (like superficial spreading melanoma) commonly carry activating BRAF^V600E mutations – this is the most frequent driver in younger patients/tumors arising from intermittently UV-exposed skin【1】. Such tumors also show moderate mutation burden often with a UV-signature (C>T transitions from UV damage)【2】. In older patients with chronically sun-exposed skin (e.g. facial lentigo maligna melanoma), there is a preponderance of NRAS mutations or inactivation of the tumor suppressor NF1, accompanied by very high total mutation counts with a UV signature【1】. Desmoplastic melanoma, a variant often arising from lentigo maligna, exemplifies this high UV damage: it was found to have some of the highest mutation burdens and frequent NF1 alterations【1】. These patterns underline how UV etiology drives specific genetic changes: high cumulative UV exposure tends to produce NRAS or NF1-driven tumors with many mutations, whereas lower, intermittent UV exposure more often yields BRAF-driven tumors【1】【2】. In all cutaneous cases, the TERT promoter is a common mutational target (mutated in ~50% of cases) to maintain telomeres【1】.

By contrast, acral and mucosal melanomas arise in sun-shielded locations (acral skin of palms/soles/nails; mucous membranes) and accordingly lack UV-signature mutations【2】. Genome-wide analyses show these subtypes have significantly lower point mutation burdens than cutaneous tumors【2】. Instead, they are characterized by frequent copy number variations and structural rearrangements【1】【2】. Hayward et al. (2017) demonstrated that acral and mucosal melanomas accumulate “large-scale genetic aberrations” – e.g. amplifications of chromosomal regions harboring oncogenes and deletions of tumor suppressors – rather than the small UV-induced nucleotide changes prevalent in cutaneous melanoma【2】. Consistent with this, key drivers in acral/mucosal melanoma often involve gene amplifications or mutations in receptor tyrosine kinase/RAS pathway genes. For instance, KIT is often activated: about one-third of acral and mucosal melanomas have either KIT mutations or copy-number gains, whereas KIT alterations are rare in ordinary cutaneous melanoma【1】. Amplification of the CCND1 locus (11q13) and CDK4 (12q14) – driving cell cycle progression – is also enriched in acral melanoma【1】. Notably, the TERT promoter is mutated in a much smaller fraction of mucosal melanomas (~8%) compared to cutaneous cases, although many mucosal tumors instead show TERT gene amplification (5p copy gain) as an alternate mechanism for telomere maintenance【1】【3】. Acral melanomas too have intermediate TERT promoter mutation rates (~30%) and sometimes amplifications【1】. This highlights that while the biological pathways (MAPK activation, cell cycle activation, telomere maintenance) are important across melanoma subtypes, the genetic mechanism by which those pathways are dysregulated can differ by subtype and anatomic origin【1】【2】.

Uveal melanoma, arising from melanocytes in the eye’s uveal tract, is the clearest outlier in terms of genetics. Uveal tumors almost never have BRAF or NRAS mutations – instead, >80% harbor activating mutations in GNAQ or GNA11, genes encoding G-protein alpha subunits in melanocyte signaling【2】. These occur early and are considered initiating oncogenic events in uveal melanoma. Subsequent mutations in BAP1 (a chromatin regulator), SF3B1 (a spliceosome factor), or EIF1AX define molecular subtypes of uveal melanoma with different prognoses【2】. Loss-of-function of BAP1 in uveal melanoma is strongly associated with metastasis, and it correlates with a distinct genome-wide DNA methylation pattern and gene expression profile (called “Class 2” uveal melanoma)【2】【3】. In fact, Jurmeister et al. (2022) showed that unsupervised DNA methylation profiling cleanly separates uveal melanomas from all other melanoma types【3】. In their analysis, cutaneous, acral, mucosal, and even conjunctival melanomas grouped together by methylation marks, whereas uveal melanomas formed a separate cluster, underscoring a fundamentally different epigenetic program【3】. Interestingly, conjunctival melanoma (arising from ocular surface melanocytes exposed to UV) is more similar to cutaneous/mucosal melanoma in mutation profile (it can have BRAF or NRAS mutations) and methylation, whereas the intraocular uveal melanoma remains distinct【3】. This reinforces that tissue of origin drives molecular distinctions: only the melanocytes of the uveal inner eye (which arise from a specific neural crest sub-lineage and dwell in a low-UV, immune-privileged site) give rise to the GNAQ-mutant/BAP1-mutant uveal melanoma subtype【2】.

Beyond mutations, epigenetic landscapes vary by subtype in ways connected to developmental origin and environment. As mentioned, uveal melanomas have a unique DNA methylation and chromatin state. But among cutaneous, acral, and mucosal melanomas, there is a surprising overall similarity in global methylation patterns【3】. Jurmeister et al. found that primary-site identification via methylome is challenging for non-uveal melanomas because, at a whole-genome level, their methylation profiles were largely overlapping【3】. Nonetheless, certain promoter-specific methylation events differ by subtype: for example, mucosal melanomas showed significantly lower frequencies of CDKN2A promoter methylation than cutaneous melanomas【3】. Also, all tested paranasal sinus melanomas in that study had PTEN promoter methylation and loss of PTEN protein, a feature much less common in other mucosal or cutaneous sites【3】. These epigenetic modifications can cooperate with genomic mutations (e.g. silencing additional tumor suppressors like PTEN) and often reflect adaptation to the local tissue context (e.g. sinonasal mucosa). Likewise, gene expression (“transcriptional”) programs in melanoma align with both the driver mutations and the melanoma’s lineage. Cutaneous melanomas often display a MITF-driven melanocytic program, since MITF is a crucial lineage transcription factor often upregulated by BRAFV600E signaling. In contrast, melanomas with alternative drivers or arising from less pigmented cell types can show non-melanocytic gene signatures. A salient example is desmoplastic melanoma, which frequently loses classical melanocytic markers and instead expresses genes associated with Schwann cells, nerve growth factor receptors, and extracellular matrix remodeling【1】【2】. This is consistent with its histology (fibrosis, neurotropism) and excellent response to immune checkpoint therapy (due in part to a high mutational load and an “inflamed” gene expression microenvironment with many immune genes). Another example is the distinction between “high-MITF” versus “AXL-high” melanoma cell states: while both can occur within a tumor (reflecting phenotype switching), certain subtypes might predispose to one state. For instance, acral/mucosal melanomas, which often have lower MITF levels and higher frequency of copy number alterations, may more readily adopt an AXL-high, invasive, and drug-resistant transcriptional state (though research is ongoing)【2】. Moreover, site-related expression patterns have been noted: acral melanomas show enrichment of genes related to keratinocyte signaling and wound healing (perhaps due to pressure or injury at acral sites), whereas mucosal melanomas express gene sets related to mucosal biology (e.g. pigmentation genes plus mucin/stromal interaction genes) – data that are beginning to emerge from transcriptomic comparisons.

Crucially, these genetic, epigenetic, and expression differences are thought to arise because melanocyte populations differ by anatomic site and differentiation stage. Melanocytes originate from neural crest cells, but their developmental journey varies. It’s been shown in animal models that melanomas can originate from either fully differentiated melanocytes or from less differentiated melanocyte stem/progenitor cells, depending on the context【5】. Castro-Pérez et al. (2023) review highlights that mouse models can initiate melanoma from melanocyte stem cells (e.g. in hair follicles) or from mature melanocytes, with different outcomes【5】. This suggests human melanoma subtypes might trace back to distinct cells of origin: for example, a superficial spreading melanoma might develop from an existing nevus (clonal expansion of differentiated melanocytes in the epidermis), whereas a lentiginous melanoma on heavily sun-damaged skin might arise from a dormant melanocyte stem cell that was activated by chronic UV-induced injury and accumulated mutations【5】. Such a stem cell origin could explain the often multi-focal, field-like growth of lentigo maligna. In acral skin and mucosal membranes, melanocytes are relatively sparse and are thought to originate from Schwann cell precursors associated with peripheral nerves (since during embryogenesis, some neural crest cells colonize distal sites via nerve migration)【4】【5】. Consistent with this, Weiss et al. (2022) demonstrated that melanocytes from different body sites carry positional molecular identities (e.g. HOX gene expression patterns) and that these identities influence which oncogenes can transform them【4】. Their work showed that certain oncogenic mutations are preferentially successful in certain anatomic contexts – pointing to differences in the “oncogenic competence” of melanocytes depending on their developmental history【4】. For instance, acral melanocytes (HOX13-positive, limb-type) might require a different set of mutations (or incur chromosomal instability) to become malignant, whereas truncal melanocytes (HOX10/HOXB-positive) readily transform with BRAFV600E plus TERT promoter mutation【4】. This aligns with the observed reality: BRAFV600E-mutant melanomas are common on the trunk but relatively rare in acral areas, whereas acral melanomas more often show KIT or focal amplifications. Mucosal melanocytes, too, reside in unique niches (such as sinonasal or genitourinary mucosa) often near nerve fibers, and may have a lower baseline mutation rate but greater propensity for structural variations, reflecting differences in how these cells handle DNA damage or replication stress. Finally, the uveal melanocyte lineage in the eye arises from a specific subset of neural crest cells and develops in an environment with distinct growth factors and immune privilege; accordingly, transformation of these cells follows a unique route (GNAQ/GNA11 activation and BAP1 loss) that diverges from cutaneous melanoma【2】. The strong link between BAP1 loss, chromatin state, and an undifferentiated phenotype in uveal melanoma underscores how the cell of origin’s epigenetic program dictates tumor behavior: loss of BAP1 in uveal melanocytes likely pushes them back toward a primitive, migratory neural crest-like state, which is associated with high metastatic risk.

In summary, each melanoma histological subtype can be defined by a characteristic combination of mutations (genetic features), methylation/chromatin patterns (epigenetic features), and gene expression programs (transcriptional features). These differences are not random; rather, they reflect the melanocyte of origin’s developmental pathway and the environmental exposures at the tumor’s site of origin. Modern genomic studies and comparative analyses have cemented the concept that melanoma is a collection of related but distinct diseases arising from the diverse lineage of melanocytes scattered throughout the body【4】【5】. Recognizing these distinctions is important not only for understanding melanoma biology but also for developing subtype-specific prevention and treatment strategies (for instance, c-KIT inhibitors in KIT-mutant acral/mucosal melanoma, or tailored immune approaches for uveal melanoma’s unique microenvironment). The evidence thus supports that the genetic/epigenetic hallmarks of each melanoma subtype are a direct consequence of where and how that melanoma began – linking back to the cell (and context) of origin in each case【5】.","Rabbie, R., Ferguson, P., Molina‐Aguilar, C., Adams, D.

These differences impact clinical behavior and therapeutic response [1]. 

Melanoma subtypes exhibit diverse molecular profiles, suggesting that the cell of origin, likely a melanocyte precursor cell, is influenced by both intrinsic genetic events and extrinsic factors from its specific anatomical location [1]. 
Genetic Features
Different melanoma subtypes are characterized by mutually exclusive genetic alterations [1]. 
Cutaneous Melanoma (CM) This subtype has the highest tumor mutation burden and often features mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or NF1 genes, which activate the MAPK signaling pathway [1]. The origin is generally considered to be from melanocytes in the skin, where UV radiation is a primary mutagenic factor contributing to its high mutational load [1].
Acral Melanoma (AM) and Mucosal Melanoma (MM) These subtypes, arising in less sun-exposed areas, display lower mutation burdens and are less frequently associated with BRAF, NRAS, or NF1 mutations [1]. Instead, they are more often characterized by KIT gene amplifications or mutations, as well as mutations in GNAQ/GNA11 genes [1]. Their origins are linked to melanocytes in specific mucosal or acral sites, and their unique genetic landscape reflects different environmental and developmental influences compared to CM [1].
Uveal Melanoma (UM) Arising in the eye, UM is genetically distinct from other forms of melanoma. It is largely characterized by mutations in GNAQ or GNA11 genes, which activate the phospholipase C pathway [1]. UM has a very low mutation burden [1]. The developmental origin of the uveal melanocyte is a crucial factor in its distinct biology [1]. 
Epigenetic Features
The epigenetic landscape is also diverse across subtypes [1]. The unique developmental trajectory and microenvironment of each melanocyte origin point to distinct epigenetic programming that is maintained in the cancer cells [1]. For instance, differential DNA methylation patterns have been observed that correlate with the primary site of the tumor [1]. These epigenetic modifications are thought to help shape the subtype-specific transcriptional programs [1]. 
Transcriptional Programs and Cell of Origin
Transcriptional profiling reveals subtype-specific gene expression patterns [1]. These programs often reflect the developmental stage and lineage of the cell of origin. 
The expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is critical in melanoma [1]. Subtypes can exhibit different levels and activity of MITF. A ""melanocytic"" phenotype is generally associated with higher MITF expression, while a ""neural crest stem cell"" or ""mesenchymal"" phenotype is associated with lower MITF expression and the expression of markers like Axl [1].
The specific microenvironments (skin, mucosa, eye) encountered during neural crest cell migration and differentiation are believed to impose unique transcriptional and epigenetic constraints, ultimately contributing to the distinct molecular subtypes of melanoma observed in different anatomical locations [1].","[1] Oh, S., G Sellers, L.

55,Melanoma,How are developmental programs of neural crest and melanocytes co-opted by melanoma for adaptation to the environments and therapeutic resistance?,Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER: Melanoma co-opts developmental programs of its progenitor cells, the neural crest and melanocytes, to adapt to changing environments and develop therapeutic resistance through several key mechanisms. It reactivates a plastic, migratory, and stem-like state resembling that of neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), which is intrinsically resistant to therapy. This is driven by the dysregulation of core developmental transcription factors such as SOX10, MSX1, YY1, and PAX3. This dedifferentiation is a central component of ""phenotype switching,"" where melanoma cells dynamically transition between a proliferative, melanocytic state (often MITF-high) and an invasive, NCSC-like state (often MITF-low, AXL-high). This heterogeneity allows subpopulations to survive therapeutic pressures and environmental stresses like hypoxia or nutrient deprivation. Melanoma also hijacks specific developmental signaling pathways, such as the LPAR1-RAPGEF5-RAP1A axis, which is normally active in neuronal progenitors but not mature melanocytes, to drive proliferation, invasion, and resistance to MAPK inhibitors by activating mTOR and YAP signaling. Furthermore, melanoma repurposes developmental metabolic programs, demonstrating vulnerabilities to nucleotide depletion similar to neural crest cells and a dependence on lipid metabolism and peroxisomes for survival, especially in drug-tolerant persister cells. Finally, it co-opts physical and mechanical properties, such as upregulating the nuclear envelope protein LAP1C, to increase nuclear deformability, a trait essential for the extensive migration seen in both neural crest development and cancer metastasis. These co-opted programs collectively endow melanoma with the plasticity and adaptability needed for progression, metastasis, and the development of intrinsic and acquired drug resistance.

ANALYSIS:
### **1. Introduction: Melanoma and Its Developmental Origins**

Melanoma is a type of cancer that originates from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing the pigment melanin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma). While most commonly found in the skin, melanomas can also arise in other tissues containing melanocytes, such as the mouth, eyes, or intestines. In rare instances, it can even occur as a primary tumor in the lungs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma). Melanocytes themselves are derived from a transient embryonic cell population known as the neural crest. This developmental lineage is critical, as melanoma cells often share characteristics with melanocyte precursors and neural crest cells, suggesting that they reactivate or ""co-opt"" the developmental programs of their cellular ancestors to drive tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance (PMID:25109840; PMID:19795394).

### **2. Developmental Programs of Neural Crest Cells and Melanocytes**

#### **2.1. The Neural Crest Developmental Program**

The neural crest is a temporary structure that forms during vertebrate embryonic development at the border between the neural plate and the epidermal ectoderm. Through a process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), neural crest cells (NCCs) delaminate from this structure and migrate extensively throughout the embryo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_crest). NCCs are multipotent progenitors that give rise to a vast and diverse array of cell types, including melanocytes, peripheral neurons and glia, craniofacial cartilage and bone, and smooth muscle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_crest).

The developmental potential of NCCs is exceptionally broad, challenging the paradigm of progressive lineage restriction after gastrulation. For instance, cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs), which originate from the ectoderm, can generate both ectodermal derivatives like neurons and mesenchymal tissues like bone and cartilage (PMID:33542111; PMID:36724256). This broad potential is governed by a complex gene regulatory network (GRN) that integrates intrinsic and environmental signals to control cell identity (PMID:31702881). Key transcription factors, such as TFAP2A, are crucial for specifying neural crest fate (PMID:28886367). Studies show that NCCs exist in a transient state of heightened chromatin accessibility, with biases toward either neuronal or ectomesenchymal fates, indicating a highly dynamic and plastic cellular state during development (PMID:36724256; PMID:31171666).

#### **2.2. The Melanocyte Developmental Program**

Melanocytes are the pigment-producing cells that arise from NCCs during embryonic development. This process involves the specification of melanocyte fate in the neural crest, followed by the migration of precursor cells (melanoblasts) to their final destinations in the skin and hair follicles, and their subsequent differentiation (PMID:19795394). In hair follicles, a population of melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) located in the bulge and hair germ area is responsible for regenerating the differentiated, pigment-producing melanocytes that color the hair during its growth phase (PMID:37076619). The proper development and migration of melanocytes are critical, and disruptions in these processes can lead to pigmentation disorders like piebaldism, which is characterized by the congenital absence of melanocytes in specific areas of the skin and hair (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piebaldism).

The transcriptional programs governing human melanocyte differentiation are distinct from those in other model organisms, and these human-specific signatures can be used to define patterns of dedifferentiation that are predictive of melanoma prognosis and therapeutic response (PMID:34475532). Many of the genes and pathways essential for normal melanocyte development, specification, and maintenance have been implicated in the formation and progression of melanoma, highlighting the close connection between the normal developmental process and its malignant counterpart (PMID:25109840; PMID:19795394).

### **3. The Concept of Co-option in Cancer Biology**

Co-option, also known as exaptation in evolutionary biology, is a process where a trait that evolved for one function is repurposed for a different function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaptation). In cancer biology, this concept describes how tumor cells hijack and repurpose pre-existing biological programs, cellular machinery, and host systems to support their own survival, growth, and dissemination. Cancer cells do not operate in isolation; they actively co-opt components of their local and systemic microenvironments (PMID:27829148; PMID:33442008).

This co-option can occur at multiple levels:
*   **Co-option of Developmental Programs:** Cancer cells can reactivate latent developmental pathways from their cell of origin. These states are often constrained by the organism's ""developmental map,"" meaning cancer cell states are typically proximate to the developmental hierarchy of the original cell type (PMID:38848676).
*   **Co-option of Cellular Machinery:** Tumors can exploit fundamental cellular processes like nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) to downregulate tumor suppressors (PMID:32213869) or alter mitochondrial functions to adapt to the harsh tumor microenvironment and resist chemotherapy (PMID:30820778).
*   **Co-option of Systemic Pathways:** Cancer cells can co-opt systemic signaling pathways, such as the insulin-PI3K cascade, which normally integrates nutrient status with cell growth and survival, to fuel their own proliferation (PMID:32127696).
*   **Co-option of Host Cell Types:** Tumors can recruit and reprogram host cells, such as neutrophils or macrophages, to contribute to disease progression and immune evasion (PMID:30816340; PMID:29130936).
*   **Co-option of Genetic Elements:** Oncogenesis can involve the co-option of transposable elements (TEs) from pluripotent stem cells as regulatory elements to drive aberrant gene expression (PMID:37694973) or the co-option of LTRs from TEs as alternative promoters to activate oncogenes following disruptions in chromatin topology (PMID:40588507).

### **4. Melanoma's Co-option of Neural Crest and Melanocyte Programs**

Melanoma provides a classic example of a cancer that hijacks developmental programs for its own benefit. Its initiation and progression are associated with the transcriptional reprogramming of melanocytes to a state that resembles their neural crest origin (PMID:34281491). This reversion allows melanoma cells to acquire traits like plasticity, invasiveness, and therapeutic resistance, which are characteristic of embryonic neural crest cells.

#### **4.1. Reactivation of a Neural Crest Stem Cell (NCSC)-like State**

A central theme in melanoma adaptation is the dedifferentiation of tumor cells into a neural crest stem cell (NCSC)-like state. This state is molecularly and biologically akin to embryonic neural crest progenitors, exhibiting high invasiveness, plasticity, and self-renewal capacity (PMID:34462276).
*   **Melanoma Initiation:** Live imaging in zebrafish models has shown that melanoma can be initiated when a single melanocyte within a cancer-prone field (carrying BRAF(V600E) and p53 mutations) reactivates an NCP (neural crest progenitor) state, marked by the re-expression of the embryonic gene *crestin* (PMID:26823433). This highlights the re-emergence of an embryonic state as a key event in melanoma initiation.
*   **Therapy Resistance:** Single-cell RNA sequencing of melanoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) treated with RAF/MEK inhibitors identified distinct drug-tolerant transcriptional states within the minimal residual disease (MRD). One of these states exhibited a neural crest stem cell (NCSC) program, driven in part by the nuclear receptor RXRG. Antagonizing RXR could mitigate the accumulation of these NCSC-like cells and delay the development of resistance, identifying this developmental state as a key driver of relapse (PMID:30017245).
*   **Shared Molecular Machinery:** Aggressive tumor cells, including melanoma, share many characteristics and molecular markers with multipotent, invasive embryonic progenitors like the neural crest (PMID:18629870). Studies have shown that malignant melanoma cells hijack parts of the neural crest developmental program, including the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like events used by NCCs for migration, to facilitate metastasis (PMID:23774755).

#### **4.2. Hijacking Specific Developmental Pathways for Survival and Resistance**

Melanoma co-opts specific signaling and metabolic pathways that are active during neural crest and melanocyte development to sustain its growth and survive therapy.

*   **The LPAR1-Axis:** A transcriptome juxtaposition study comparing human NCLSCs, melanocytes, and melanoma cultures identified lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) as a gene highly expressed in NCLSCs and melanoma cells but not in mature melanocytes. LPAR1 is a G12/13-coupled receptor known to drive the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells. In melanoma, the LPAR1 signaling axis (LPAR1→RAPGEF5→RAP1A) promotes proliferation, mobility, invasiveness, and both intrinsic and acquired resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors by sustaining mTOR and YAP activity. LPAR1 expression increases as melanoma progresses and upon acquisition of drug resistance, making it a novel therapeutic target for eliminating the therapy-resistant, dedifferentiated NCLSC-like melanoma cell population (PMID:34462276).
*   **Metabolic Reprogramming:** Melanoma cells co-opt developmental metabolic dependencies.
    *   **Nucleotide Metabolism:** Neural crest cells have a unique sensitivity to nucleotide depletion. This developmental susceptibility is conserved in melanoma. Inhibitors of the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which is involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis, abrogate neural crest development and also decrease melanoma growth, highlighting a shared metabolic vulnerability that can be therapeutically exploited (PMID:21430780; PMID:34281491).
    *   **Lipid Metabolism:** A zebrafish melanoma model identified a transcriptional program linking a pigmented, melanocytic cell state to a dependence on lipid droplets and fatty acid oxidative metabolism. This metabolic state is conserved in human melanomas and is associated with poor patient outcomes, representing a metabolic vulnerability linked to a specific differentiation state (PMID:37268606). Furthermore, melanoma cells tolerate MAPK inhibitors by reprogramming lipid metabolism via peroxisomes. A specific drug-tolerant subpopulation of ""starved-like melanoma cells"" (SMCs), marked by CD36 expression, is dependent on peroxisome and UGCG-mediated ceramide metabolism for survival. Co-targeting peroxisome biogenesis (via PEX3) and ceramide metabolism (via UGCG) can eliminate these persister cells and delay resistance (PMID:37616051).
    *   **YY1-Controlled Metabolism:** The transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a critical regulator of NCSC development, governing proliferation and survival. In a melanoma mouse model, reducing YY1 levels prevented tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, YY1 controls multiple metabolic pathways and protein synthesis in both NCSCs and melanoma, acting as part of a gene regulatory network that includes MITF and c-MYC. This demonstrates that both normal NCSC development and melanoma formation depend on an intricate, YY1-controlled metabolic program (PMID:30951662).

*   **Phenotype Switching and Environmental Adaptation:** Melanoma's ability to co-opt developmental programs confers remarkable plasticity, allowing it to adapt to diverse microenvironmental cues.
    *   **The Aged Microenvironment:** The aged microenvironment can drive melanoma progression and therapy resistance. Aged dermal fibroblasts secrete the Wnt antagonist sFRP2, which suppresses β-catenin and MITF in melanoma cells. This leads to the loss of the redox effector APE1, rendering the melanoma cells more resistant to targeted therapy (vemurafenib) and promoting angiogenesis and metastasis (PMID:27042933).
    *   **Hypoxia:** A hypoxic microenvironment can trigger a switch in melanoma cells from a proliferative, ROR1-positive phenotype to an invasive, ROR2-positive phenotype by activating noncanonical Wnt5A signaling. This switch also induces a tenfold decrease in sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors, directly linking an environmental stressor to the co-option of a developmental signaling pathway for therapy resistance (PMID:24104062).
    *   **Brain Metastasis:** To survive and grow in the brain, melanoma cells co-opt mechanisms related to neurodegenerative pathologies. They secrete amyloid beta (Aβ), which activates surrounding astrocytes to a pro-metastatic state and prevents microglia from phagocytosing the tumor cells. This demonstrates a novel co-option of neuro-inflammatory pathways for adaptation to a specific metastatic niche (PMID:35262173).

#### **4.3. Co-option of Molecular and Physical Mechanisms**

The reactivation of developmental programs involves the dysregulation of key molecular players and the repurposing of physical cellular properties.

*   **Core Developmental Transcription Factors:** Several transcription factors that orchestrate neural crest and melanocyte development are central to melanoma plasticity.
    *   **SOX10:** Crucial for NC cell survival and melanocyte specification, SOX10 is also a key part of the melanoma-initiating transcriptional program. ATAC-Seq analysis of zebrafish melanomas identified melanoma-specific enhancers for the *sox10* gene, demonstrating how cancer cells can co-opt developmental regulatory elements to drive oncogene expression (PMID:34099848).
    *   **MSX1:** An early NC specifier, MSX1 expression is reactivated in melanoma and can reprogram differentiated melanocytes and melanoma cells to a dedifferentiated, NCSC-like state, promoting an invasive phenotype associated with poor prognosis (PMID:34071193).
    *   **MITF:** The ""master regulator"" of melanogenesis, MITF levels act as a rheostat controlling melanoma cell state. Intermediate MITF levels are associated with proliferation, while low levels are linked to an invasive, drug-resistant phenotype, and high levels are linked to a differentiated, G1-arrested state. This dynamic regulation of MITF is a key driver of phenotype switching (PMID:34071193).
    *   **PAX3, FOXD3:** These TFs, which regulate MITF expression during development, are also involved in controlling melanoma cell state and drug resistance. For example, FOXD3 mediates resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors by upregulating ERBB3 (PMID:34071193).

*   **Mechanical Plasticity for Invasion:** Metastasis requires cancer cells to navigate through tight physical spaces. Neural crest cells are masters of migration through constrictive embryonic environments. Metastatic melanoma cells co-opt mechanisms to enhance their physical deformability. They exhibit increased expression of the inner nuclear membrane protein LAP1, specifically the shorter isoform LAP1C. LAP1C expression supports nuclear envelope blebbing and allows for a weaker coupling between the nuclear envelope and lamina. This renders the nucleus more adaptable and deformable, facilitating constrained migration and invasion, thereby contributing to melanoma's aggressiveness (PMID:36624187).

### **5. Conclusion: A Disease of Developmental Regression**

Melanoma's adaptability and resistance are deeply rooted in its ability to co-opt the developmental programs of its neural crest and melanocyte ancestors. This is not simply a random process but a structured regression to more primitive, plastic, and migratory cellular states. By reactivating NCSC-like transcriptional and metabolic networks, melanoma gains access to a repertoire of embryonic behaviors that are highly advantageous for surviving therapeutic attack and colonizing new environments. The hijacking of specific pathways like the LPAR1 axis for drug resistance, the repurposing of lipid metabolism for survival, and the re-engagement of mechanical properties like nuclear plasticity for invasion all underscore a central theme: melanoma's progression is a form of developmental pathology. The insights gained from studying these co-opted developmental programs reveal unique vulnerabilities. Rather than targeting the end-stage consequences of malignancy, therapies aimed at the core developmental dependencies—be they signaling pathways like LPAR1, metabolic programs like ceramide synthesis, or key transcription factors—represent a rational and promising strategy to dismantle the foundations of melanoma's resilience and adaptability.","1.

This developmental reprogramming enables phenotypic plasticity, allowing melanoma cells to switch between proliferative/differentiated and invasive/stem-like states in response to microenvironmental pressures and therapeutic stress. [1-3] The reemergence of neural crest stem cell (NCSC)-like properties confers survival advantages, including enhanced migration, self-renewal capacity, and resistance to both targeted therapies and immunotherapies. [4-5]

Neural Crest Transcription Factors Drive Melanoma Plasticity
Five master transcription factors central to neural crest development—MSX1, MITF, SOX10, PAX3, and FOXD3—are reactivated in melanoma and orchestrate phenotypic switching. These factors regulate the balance between proliferative and invasive states, with MITF serving as the central rheostat. [1] MSX1 induces neural crest-like reprogramming that promotes melanoma progression by driving a phenotypic switch from an E-cadherin-high nonmigratory state to a ZEB1-high invasive state, with MSX1 depletion significantly inhibiting metastasis in vivo. [6] SOX10 forms complexes with chromatin-modifying enzymes like ATAD2, allowing expression of downstream oncogenic and neural crest programs that determine oncogenic competence. [7]
The transcriptional plasticity observed in melanoma recapitulates distinct melanocyte developmental states from neural crest origins. Melanoma cells can transition between differentiated melanocytic phenotypes (high MITF, melanin production) and dedifferentiated neural crest-like states (high invasiveness, stem cell markers). [2-3] This phenotype switching is not random but follows developmental trajectories, with melanoma evolution mirroring the hierarchic process of neural crest differentiation. [8]
Developmental Migration Programs Enable Invasion and Metastasis
Melanoma cells hijack the embryonic neural crest migration program to facilitate invasion and metastasis. When exposed to embryonic microenvironments, metastatic melanoma cells dynamically regulate genes associated with neural crest induction, delamination, and migration, exploiting neural crest-related receptor tyrosine kinases to increase plasticity. [9-10] The melanocyte differentiation program itself predisposes to metastasis after neoplastic transformation, with the master regulator Slug (SNAI2) being required for metastasis of transformed melanoma cells. [11]
Melanoma cells revive embryonic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs to dissociate from surrounding keratinocytes, similar to how neural crest cells undergo EMT to exit the dorsal neural tube. [10][12] EMT-inducing transcription factors serve as major drivers of phenotype switching between differentiated/proliferative and neural crest stem cell-like/invasive states, contributing to intratumoral heterogeneity. [13]
Neural Crest Stem Cell-Like States Mediate Therapeutic Resistance
The emergence of NCSC-like populations in minimal residual disease (MRD) is a critical determinant of nongenetic resistance to targeted therapies. In melanoma exposed to MAPK pathway inhibitors, a transient neural crest stem cell population emerges through a glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)-dependent signaling cascade that activates the AKT survival pathway in a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent manner. [5] Ablation of this NCSC population through FAK inhibition delays relapse, though tumors that ultimately escape exhibit resistance-conferring genetic alterations. [5]
Neural crest-associated genes like LPAR1 and ERRFI1 are upregulated during melanoma progression and acquisition of therapeutic resistance. LPAR1 activity increases following BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment, and genetic inhibition of LPAR1 potentiates therapy efficacy while ablating melanoma migration and invasion. [14] Similarly, ERRFI1 expression is elevated in metastatic melanoma, negatively correlates with melanocytic differentiation markers, and its downregulation increases susceptibility to BRAF inhibition by diminishing MAPK and AKT pathway activation. [15]
The CD271/p75 neurotrophin receptor, a neural crest marker, plays convergent roles in tumor initiation, phenotype switching, and reprogramming of metastatic melanoma, contributing to melanoma plasticity. [16] Melanoma cells expressing neural crest markers demonstrate multipotent characteristics and can undergo trans-differentiation along vascular and neural lineages, properties associated with stem cell-like behavior and drug resistance. [3]
Developmental Chromatin Programs Determine Oncogenic Competence
The transforming ability of BRAF and other oncogenic mutations depends on the intrinsic transcriptional program present in the cell of origin. Neural crest progenitors and melanoblasts are readily transformed, while differentiated melanocytes are less responsive to mutations. [7] This oncogenic competence is mediated by higher expression of chromatin-modifying enzymes in progenitor populations, such as ATAD2, which forms complexes with SOX10 to enable expression of oncogenic programs. [7]
Melanoma can arise from either melanocyte stem cells or differentiated melanocytes depending on anatomical site and oncogenic context, with different cells of origin potentially explaining the molecular heterogeneity observed across melanoma subtypes. [2-3] The cellular composition of MRD deterministically imposes distinct drug resistance evolutionary paths, with NCSC-enriched MRD favoring nongenetic resistance mechanisms. [5]
Metabolic Vulnerabilities Inherited from Neural Crest
Neural crest cells have unique sensitivity to nucleotide depletion, a metabolic vulnerability conserved in melanoma. The pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme DHODH is particularly critical for neural crest-derived tissues, and nucleotide stress responses that affect neural crest development can be exploited therapeutically in melanoma. [17] This developmental susceptibility provides a metabolic target that may circumvent resistance mechanisms.
Microenvironmental Reprogramming and Plasticity
The embryonic microenvironment can reprogram metastatic melanoma cells to assume neural crest cell-like phenotypes. When transplanted adjacent to premigratory neural crest cells in chick embryos, human metastatic melanoma cells do not form tumors but instead invade along neural crest migratory pathways, populate peripheral structures, and express both melanocyte-specific (MART-1) and neuronal (Tuj1) markers. [18] This demonstrates the remarkable plasticity of melanoma cells and their ability to respond to developmental cues.
The glia/melanocyte fate decision during neural crest development has implications for melanoma plasticity. Schwann cell precursors serve as a secondary source of melanocytes during development, and during melanomagenesis, cells can exhibit both melanocytic and glial features, suggesting reactivation of this developmental plasticity.

This allows melanoma cells to switch between differentiated melanocytic states and dedifferentiated, neural crest-like states, fostering heterogeneity and adaptability. By hijacking neural crest regulatory networks (e.g. SOX10, PAX3, MITF), melanoma can assume migratory, stem-like phenotypes reminiscent of embryonic neural crest cells, which promotes invasion into diverse microenvironments and metastasis【1】【4】. Concurrently, melanoma cells can downregulate melanocytic differentiation factors like MITF and upregulate neural crest markers (e.g. NGFR/CD271), enabling transitions to slow-cycling, therapy-resistant cell states【1】【2】. This developmental plasticity underlies melanoma’s ability to adapt to environmental stresses and resist treatments – for example, cells in a neural crest–like state exhibit increased invasiveness and survival under targeted therapies and may evade immune attack via elevated checkpoints like PD-L1【3】【5】. In sum, melanoma co-opts neural crest and melanocyte developmental programs to dynamically alter its phenotype, enhancing its environmental fitness and therapeutic resistance【2】【3】.

Melanoma originates from melanocytes, which are themselves derived from the embryonic neural crest – a highly migratory, multipotent cell population. Owing to this origin, melanoma cells retain a profound developmental plasticity【1】. They can invoke gene expression programs normally seen in neural crest cells and melanocyte precursors, resulting in intratumoral heterogeneity. Indeed, melanoma tumors contain subpopulations ranging from terminally differentiated, pigment-producing melanocytic cells to cells expressing gene profiles typical of other neural crest derivatives【2】. This means that the tumor can oscillate between a more melanocyte-like state and a neural crest stem cell-like state. Such phenotype switching recapitulates the normal developmental continuum – for example, high levels of the master melanocyte regulator MITF drive differentiation/proliferation, whereas MITF-low, neural crest-like states confer a de-differentiated, slow-cycling phenotype【1】【2】. Melanoma exploits this developmental program flexibility to “hijack” or co-opt embryonic pathways for its own benefit【2】. As one review notes, increasing evidence shows that melanoma cells “have hijacked developmental programs” of the neural crest, giving them stem-like traits within the tumor【2】. Neural crest transcription factors such as SOX10, PAX3, and FOXD3 – critical for normal melanocyte development – are aberrantly regulated in melanoma, contributing to this cell-state plasticity【1】. For instance, SOX10 is required for melanocytic identity; melanoma cells that lose SOX10 can revert to a more primitive, invasive state, illustrating how toggling a single neural crest factor shifts the phenotype【3】. Likewise, MITF, the lineage-specific transcription factor central to melanocyte development, is a key “rheostat” in melanoma: it is “prominent in melanocyte development” and heavily influences melanoma behavior【1】. Melanoma cells modulate MITF levels to switch identities – an MITF-high state corresponds to differentiated, pigment-producing cells, while MITF-low cells resemble neural crest progenitors that are highly invasive and drug-resistant【1】【5】. This dynamic reuse of developmental circuits underscores melanoma’s unique capacity for phenotype plasticity.

This developmental plasticity directly promotes adaptation to new environments during melanoma progression. Neural crest cells in the embryo undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to migrate and colonize distant tissues; similarly, melanoma cells can activate an EMT-like program to invade surrounding stroma and metastasize【4】. In fact, melanoma has long been described as reviving an “embryonic” migratory program – for example, the loss of E-cadherin and gain of mesenchymal markers in melanoma parallels neural crest cell delamination【4】. By adopting neural crest-like migratory behavior, melanoma cells can better survive detachment, navigate through diverse tissue matrices, and adapt to foreign niches such as lung, liver, or brain. Studies in model organisms and cell culture have shown that human metastatic melanoma cells often display a dedifferentiated, plastic phenotype similar to neural crest cells, which provides a selective advantage for dissemination【4】. This phenotype switching endows melanoma with the ability to fit the demands of different microenvironments. For example, a melanoma cell in a nutrient-poor or hypoxic niche might downregulate energy-intensive melanocytic functions and assume a neural crest-like state that is more stress-resistant. Conversely, in a supportive niche, it might revert to a proliferative melanocytic form. Such plasticity means the tumor is not a homogeneous mass but a dynamic mix of states, each suited to particular environmental conditions. As a recent study highlighted, melanoma cells can even de-differentiate into neural crest cell-like states during metastatic progression, indicating that metastatic lesions contain cells that have developmentally “rewound” to an earlier, more adaptable stage【3】. This flexibility is a crucial reason why melanoma metastases can colonize diverse organs; the tumor effectively taps into embryonic programs to thrive in varied tissue landscapes.

Crucially, co-opting developmental programs also drives therapeutic resistance in melanoma. The ability to switch lineage state provides a reservoir of cells that can withstand treatment. One well-characterized example is resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors (e.g. BRAF/MEK inhibitors in BRAF-mutant melanoma): melanoma cells frequently escape these drugs by shifting into a neural crest-like, drug-tolerant state. Upon exposure to BRAF inhibitors, initially many melanoma cells exhibit increased MITF and differentiation, but resistant minimal residual disease is often dominated by MITF-low, neural crest–associated cells【5】. These resistant cells commonly upregulate neural crest/stem cell markers like NGFR (CD271) and AXL while downregulating melanocyte differentiation antigens【2】【5】. Such a state is less dependent on the inhibited MAPK signaling and more mesenchymal, allowing survival and eventual tumor regrowth. In essence, the tumor leverages a developmental “escape program” – by reverting to an embryonic-like stage, the cells become less sensitive to drugs targeting features of mature melanocytic cells. This phenomenon of drug-induced dedifferentiation has been documented in both targeted therapy and immunotherapy contexts. For instance, melanoma cells with an MITF^low/NGFR^high neural crest-like phenotype not only resist targeted inhibitors but also exhibit changes that help them evade the immune system【5】. These dedifferentiated cells often express higher levels of the immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1, which can blunt T cell attack, thereby conferring resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapies【5】. Additionally, inflammatory signals from immunotherapy (e.g. IFN-γ from T cells) can push melanoma cells into a dedifferentiated state as a protective strategy, reducing expression of antigenic melanocyte proteins. Overall, the activation of neural crest developmental pathways creates a cell state that is inherently more survival-prone under therapeutic stress. It provides melanoma with a “hidden” embryonic toolkit to weather the assault of drugs: cells in this state are less proliferative (making chemo or targeted drugs less effective), more mobile (escaping localized treatment effects), and can invoke stress-response pathways shared with stem cells.

In summary, melanoma’s aggressiveness and therapy resistance are tightly linked to its co-option of neural crest and melanocyte developmental programs. By oscillating along the axis of embryonic neural crest stem-like states and differentiated melanocyte states, melanoma achieves phenotypic diversity that allows it to both adapt to environmental challenges and survive therapeutic interventions. This concept is supported by growing evidence: researchers describe melanoma as “hijacking” neural crest programs to increase its fitness【2】, and observe that cellular plasticity “enables adaptation to metastatic microenvironments and resistance to therapies”【3】. The developmental plasticity endows melanoma with quasi-stem-cell properties – motility, multipotency, and stress tolerance – that facilitate metastasis formation and the evasion of drugs. Therapeutic strategies are now being explored to target these adaptive, neural crest-like subpopulations (for example, by targeting markers like NGFR or the signaling pathways active in de-differentiated cells)【2】. By understanding that melanoma in many ways behaves like “neural crest cells gone awry,” we can better appreciate why it is so adaptable and devise treatments to counteract its developmental resilience.

Frontiers in Oncology, 11, 756001.","Melanoma co-opts developmental programs of neural crest cells (NCCs) and melanocytes through a process of phenotype switching or dedifferentiation, enabling cancer cells to adapt to environmental stresses and resist therapies. This mechanism involves a dynamic and reversible shift between a proliferative, differentiated melanocytic state and a slow-cycling, invasive, stem-like NCC state, driven by specific transcription factors and epigenetic modifications.

Melanoma cells, originating from melanocytes which are themselves derived from multipotent embryonic NCCs, retain a high degree of plasticity. This inherent developmental potential is exploited by the tumor to survive targeted therapies and immunotherapies. 
The core of this adaptation lies in the ability of melanoma cells to dynamically switch between distinct cell states, broadly categorized as: 
Melanocytic (differentiated) state: Characterized by high expression of the master regulator MITF and melanocyte lineage markers like Melan A (MLANA) and PMEL. Cells in this state are typically highly proliferative and sensitive to MAPK pathway inhibitors (targeted therapies).
Neural Crest Cell (NCC)-like (dedifferentiated) state: Characterized by low MITF expression, high expression of NCC markers such as AXL, NGFR (CD271), and WNT5A, and a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Cells in this state are slow-cycling, highly invasive, and resistant to both targeted therapies and immune checkpoint blockade. 
Melanoma cells leverage these developmental programs in the following ways:
Therapeutic Resistance: Upon exposure to targeted therapies (e.g., BRAF inhibitors) or immunotherapies (e.g., anti-PD-1), melanoma cells can downregulate differentiation markers (MITF) and upregulate NCC markers (AXL, NGFR) to escape treatment. This dedifferentiated, NCC-like phenotype confers an innate or acquired resistance.
Environmental Adaptation & Metastasis: The migratory and invasive properties of embryonic NCCs, which allow them to move throughout the embryo during development, are co-opted by melanoma cells for invasion and metastasis. The tumor microenvironment (TME), including factors like IFN-γ or specific signaling pathways such as Endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB), can induce these phenotype switches, allowing cells to adapt to local conditions.
Metabolic Vulnerabilities: The developmental biology of NCCs is linked to specific metabolic dependencies, such as a unique sensitivity to nucleotide depletion. Melanoma cells in the NCC-like state retain this metabolic vulnerability, which can be potentially exploited for new therapeutic strategies.
Epigenetic Remodeling: The shift in phenotype is often orchestrated by epigenetic modifications and specific transcription factors like SOX10 and FOXD1, which alter the chromatin landscape to activate neural crest-related gene expression. This dynamic transcriptional reprogramming underpins the tumor's adaptability and resistance mechanisms. ","Hossain, A., Pour, S. A., Ali, A., & Shen, J. (2023).

56,Melanoma,What are the germline variants that modulate immune microenvironment of melanoma? What are their mechanisms?,Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER: Germline variants modulate the immune microenvironment of melanoma through diverse mechanisms that influence immune cell populations, signaling pathways, gene expression, and response to therapy. Key findings indicate that the presence of germline pathogenic variants (gPVs) can lead to an enhanced inflammatory microenvironment, characterized by lower levels of immunosuppressive cells like polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), which correlates with improved survival in melanoma patients. Specific variants in or affecting natural killer (NK) cells are associated with the characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME); fewer defective inherited NK cell genes correlate with ""TIME-rich"" tumors with more tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and better response to immune checkpoint therapy.

Mechanistically, germline variants can alter immune function by directly impacting signaling pathways and gene expression. For instance, a variant in *ITGA4* has been shown to enhance T-cell receptor signaling and CD8 T-cell cytotoxicity against melanoma cells. Variants in predisposition genes like *CDKN2A* and *MC1R* can deregulate the expression of immunity-related genes, including interferon-stimulated genes. Similarly, variants in the *IL10* gene are associated with melanoma survival and alter cytokine secretion by CD4+ T cells. These inherited genetic differences can also influence susceptibility to tumor immune evasion and modulate clinical outcomes of immunotherapy. Variants in DNA repair genes (e.g., *BRCA2*, *POLE*) have been linked to resistance to immunotherapy, potentially by impairing lymphocyte development, while a variant in *MBD4* is associated with a high tumor mutation burden and a positive response to treatment. Furthermore, genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity, conferred by specific SNPs, has been linked to increased efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma.

ANALYSIS: 
### **Introduction to Germline Variants, Melanoma, and the Immune Microenvironment**

Melanoma is a form of cancer that originates from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin pigment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma). The progression of melanoma and its response to treatment are heavily influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), a complex ecosystem comprising cancer cells, stromal cells, the extracellular matrix, and various immune cells. The dynamic interactions within this microenvironment can either support tumor growth and immune evasion or promote an effective anti-tumor immune response (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_microenvironment). This report investigates the role of germline variants—inherited genetic alterations—in modulating the immune microenvironment of melanoma, thereby influencing cancer risk, patient prognosis, and the efficacy of immunotherapies.

### **Mechanisms of Germline Variant Influence on the Immune Microenvironment**

Germline variants can exert their influence on the tumor and its microenvironment through several molecular mechanisms. These inherited variants can lead to amino acid changes in proteins, alter gene splicing patterns, or modify gene expression levels. Such molecular changes can affect the selection of subsequent somatic mutations, cause genome-wide mutational patterns, and ultimately give rise to distinct tumor phenotypes, including alterations to the immune microenvironment and modulation of therapeutic response (PMID:33203571). Evidence suggests that host genetics fundamentally influences patients' inherent immune profiles. Common germline variants have been associated with both gene expression and the infiltration of immune cells into tumors, with a notable enrichment for genes involved in immune processes, indicating that hereditary genetics can shape the expression of key immune genes (PMID:30463956). Research in colorectal cancer has also demonstrated that germline genetic variation can influence the quantity and diversity of adaptive immune responses, with a specific SNP near the *RBM20* gene being associated with T-cell clonality (PMID:38664626).

### **Impact of Germline Variants on Immune Cell Populations and Tumor Inflammation in Melanoma**

Studies have demonstrated a direct link between germline variants and the composition of the immune microenvironment in melanoma.

**1. General Germline Pathogenic Variants (gPVs) and Immune Suppression:**
A study of melanoma patients with clinical characteristics suggesting a hereditary predisposition found that those positive for a germline pathogenic variant (gPV-positive) had significantly improved melanoma-specific survival compared to gPV-negative patients. This survival benefit was associated with distinct immunological features, including a significantly lower level of circulating polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), which are known to suppress anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, analysis of the cutaneous melanoma cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a significant upregulation of inflammatory transcriptome signatures in later-stage gPV-positive patients compared to gPV-negative ones. These findings suggest that certain gPVs modulate the immune microenvironment by reducing immune suppressor cell populations and fostering an enhanced inflammatory state, which contributes to better clinical outcomes (PMID:38032355).

**2. Germline Variants in Natural Killer (NK) Cells:**
Germline variants specifically affecting natural killer (NK) cells have been shown to modulate the TIME across multiple cancer types, including melanoma. A study found that patients with fewer inherited defective genes in their NK cells were more likely to have ""TIME-rich"" tumors, characterized by a higher abundance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These patients also exhibited better prognosis and a more favorable response to immune checkpoint therapy (ICT). Conversely, individuals with more inherited defective NK cell genes tended to have ""TIME-poor"" or ""TIME-intermediate"" tumors, which were associated with lower TIL abundance, poorer survival, and reduced ICT response. The proposed mechanism is that these germline defects impair the communication between NK cells and other immune cells, which in turn blocks the recruitment of TILs into the tumor, thus shaping the immune landscape (PMID:31483464).

**3. Heritability of Immune Traits:**
Further supporting the role of host genetics, another study identified high heritability for the infiltration of NK cells and T-cell subsets, as well as for interferon signaling within the tumor microenvironment. This research linked specific germline variants to differential immune signaling and T-cell abundance, confirming that an individual's genetic makeup can influence the composition and functional orientation of the tumor immune microenvironment in melanoma and other cancers (PMID:33567262).

### **Modulation of Immune Signaling Pathways and Gene Expression by Specific Variants**

Specific germline variants have been found to directly interfere with immune signaling and alter the expression of immune-related genes.

*   **T-Cell Receptor Signaling:** A phosphotyrosine-altering non-synonymous single nucleotide variation (pTyr-SNV) in the *ITGA4* gene (rs1178800678-G/T) was shown to directly impact T-cell receptor (TCR)-induced signaling. In an experimental model, CD8 T-cells engineered with this variant exhibited increased phosphorylation of the ZAP70 protein and higher levels of the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B (GZMB) upon TCR stimulation. This led to enhanced cytotoxic activity against a metastatic melanoma cell line, demonstrating how a germline variant can directly augment the anti-tumor T-cell response (PMID:36690075).
*   **Cytokine Regulation:** A study investigating genetic variants in immunomodulatory pathways identified a significant association between rs3024493 in the *IL10* gene and overall survival in melanoma patients. Functional analyses revealed that this variant was associated with the downregulation of interleukin 10 (IL10) secretion in CD4+ T-cells. This finding points to a novel role for the IL10 locus as a prognostic biomarker in melanoma and supports an alternative function of IL10 in stimulating anti-tumor immunity (PMID:25604082).
*   **Expression of Immunity-Related Genes:** Germline mutations in melanoma predisposition genes have also been linked to altered gene expression profiles. A study of primary skin cells from siblings in melanoma-prone families found that a *CDKN2A* mutation (p.G101W) led to the deregulation of 1535 transcripts, including the overexpression of immunity-related genes such as *HLA-DPB1*, *CLEC2B*, and several interferon-inducible (*IFI*) genes. In the same study, variants in the *MC1R* gene were associated with the deregulation of 3570 transcripts. These expression signatures were maintained in melanoma tumors, suggesting that transcriptome deregulation is an early event in skin cancer development driven by germline variants (PMID:24742402).

### **Germline Variants, Immune Evasion, and Immunotherapy Response**

The inherited genetic background of a patient can significantly influence how tumors evade the immune system and respond to treatments like immunotherapy.

**1. Influence on Immune Evasion:**
Tumor cells can develop mechanisms to escape immune detection, such as the loss of HLA class I expression, which prevents T-cells from recognizing tumor antigens (PMID:28423700). Germline variants can contribute to this landscape. For example, pathogenic germline variants in DNA repair genes were associated with resistance to immunotherapy, potentially by impairing lymphocyte development and T-cell differentiation, thereby precluding an effective anti-tumor immune response (PMID:32354124). Similarly, germline variants in melanoma predisposition genes such as *BAP1*, *POT1*, and *CDKN2A* influence the genetic landscape of the tumor, which can in turn affect immune evasion pathways (PMID:39315505). Other variants, such as those in melanogenesis genes (*TYR*, *TYRP1*, *OCA2*) or *APOE*, may also modulate melanoma progression and immune evasion through various mechanisms (PMID:29036293; PMID:37335131).

**2. Modulation of Immunotherapy Efficacy and Toxicity:**
Several studies have directly linked germline variants to the outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in melanoma.
*   **Resistance to Immunotherapy:** The presence of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in DNA repair genes, including *BRCA2*, *POLE*, *WRN*, *FANCI*, *CDKN2A*, *BAP1*, *PALB2*, and *RAD54B*, was associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival and melanoma-specific survival in patients receiving combined immunotherapy (PMID:32354124).
*   **Favorable Response to Immunotherapy:** Conversely, a germline loss-of-function variant in *MBD4* was associated with a high tumor mutation burden and a positive response to checkpoint inhibitor treatment in a uveal melanoma patient (PMID:30714079). Additionally, a study found that a SNP associated with genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases (rs17388568, located near immune genes *IL2* and *IL21*) was linked to an increased response to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients (PMID:30863922).
*   **Prediction of Adverse Events:** Germline genetics can also predict immune-related adverse events (irAEs). An expression quantitative trait locus (ieQTL), rs7036417, which is linked to increased expression of the *SYK* gene, was strongly associated with an increased risk of severe (grade 3-4) toxicity in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, independent of its efficacy. This suggests SYK overexpression may play a role in irAE development (PMID:37301715). Germline microRNA-based biomarkers have also shown potential in predicting irAEs to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy (PMID:35115362).

### **Overview of Key Melanoma Predisposition Genes**

While not all predisposition genes have been explicitly linked to immune modulation in the provided evidence, they form the genetic background upon which the immune microenvironment develops. Approximately 10% of melanoma cases have a family history of the disease (PMID:26337759). High-penetrance genes responsible for some familial melanoma cases include *CDKN2A*, *CDK4*, *BAP1*, *POT1*, *ACD*, *TERF2IP*, and *TERT* (PMID:26337759; PMID:33982545). The *CDKN2A* gene, which encodes two tumor suppressors (p16INK4a and p14ARF), is mutated in approximately 20-40% of melanoma-prone families and is associated with cell cycle regulation and senescence (PMID:20687502; PMID:33076392; PMID:26386262). Pathogenic variants in genes like *BRCA1* and *BRCA2*, known for their role in breast and ovarian cancer, also increase the risk for cutaneous and uveal melanoma, highlighting the role of aberrant DNA repair mechanisms in susceptibility (PMID:29641532). These genes contribute to cancer risk and progression, creating the context in which the immune system interacts with the developing tumor.","1. Chat V. et al. (2019).

Common variants in genes such as IFIH1, TMEM173 (STING1), and TMEM108 influence interferon signaling, while variants in RBL1 correlate with T cell subset abundance. [1] Pathogenic germline variants in DNA damage repair genes (particularly BRCA1, CHEK2, and homologous recombination deficiency genes) are associated with enhanced inflammatory tumor microenvironments and reduced immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells. [2-3] Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in immune-related genes, particularly those affecting IL19 and BATF3 expression, significantly impact melanoma prognosis through modulation of the immune landscape. [4]

Common Germline Variants Affecting Immune Cell Composition
Genome-wide analyses have identified specific common variants that directly influence the composition of the tumor immune microenvironment. A comprehensive study of approximately 9,000 cancer patients, including melanoma cases, demonstrated high heritability for NK cell and T cell subset infiltration estimates, as well as interferon signaling. [1] Common variants in IFIH1 (encoding MDA5, a cytoplasmic RNA sensor), TMEM173 (encoding STING1, a key mediator of innate immune responses), and TMEM108 were significantly associated with differential interferon signaling intensity. [1] Additionally, variants mapping to RBL1 correlated with T cell subset abundance, suggesting germline control over adaptive immune cell recruitment. [1]
A focused analysis of seven million autosomal germline variants identified one SNP associated with follicular helper T cell infiltration and 23 candidate genes involved in cytokine-mediated signaling. [5] These germline features form networks with genes involved in DNA repair and transcription elongation pathways, suggesting coordinated regulation of immune function. [5] Notably, polygenic risk for rheumatoid arthritis showed a positive association with CD8+ T cell infiltration, indicating that autoimmune disease susceptibility loci may enhance anti-tumor immunity. [5]
TIME-specific eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci affecting the tumor immune microenvironment) are enriched in areas of active transcription and associate with gene expression in specific immune cell subsets, particularly macrophages and dendritic cells. [6] These 1,084 TIME eQTLs can be integrated into polygenic score models that reproducibly stratify cancer risk, survival, and immune checkpoint blockade response across independent cohorts. [6]
Pathogenic Germline Variants and Immune Modulation
Patients with pathogenic germline variants (gPV) in cancer predisposition genes exhibit distinct immunologic features compared to gPV-negative melanoma patients. In a prospective cohort study, gPV-positive melanoma patients demonstrated significantly improved melanoma-specific survival (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.82, P=0.01), with the most pronounced benefit observed in cutaneous melanoma subtypes (HR 0.12, 95% CI 0.016-0.86, P=0.03). [2] This survival advantage was associated with significantly lower levels of circulating polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC) compared to gPV-negative patients (P=0.01), particularly in later-stage disease (P=0.009). [2]  Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cutaneous melanoma cohort revealed significant upregulation of inflammatory transcriptome signatures in later-stage gPV-positive patients compared to gPV-negative patients. [2] This enhanced inflammatory microenvironment suggests that germline variants in DNA damage repair pathways may prime the immune system for more effective anti-tumor responses.
The prevalence of pathogenic germline variants in melanoma is substantial, with recent studies reporting rates of 10.6% to 15.8% depending on cohort selection. [3] Notably, nearly half (46.9%) of pathogenic variants identified were in homologous recombination deficiency genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, and PALB2. [3] These DNA repair defects may generate increased neoantigen burden through genomic instability, thereby enhancing immune recognition.
Mechanisms of Immune Modulation by Specific Germline Variants
Expression quantitative trait loci in immune pathways provide mechanistic insights into how germline variants influence melanoma outcomes. A landmark study identified highly significant associations between melanoma overall survival and rs6673928 (impacting IL19 expression; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41-0.77, P=0.0002) and rs6695772 (controlling BATF3 expression; HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.19-2.24, P=0.0019). [4] Both associations map to the 1q32 locus, and their combined effect substantially enhances prognostic stratification (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.43-2.60, P=2.38e-5). [4]
IL-19 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress Th1 and Th17 responses, and variants reducing its expression may enhance anti-tumor immunity by relieving immunosuppression. BATF3 is essential for the development of conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), which are critical for cross-presentation of tumor antigens to CD8+ T cells and effective anti-tumor immunity. Variants affecting BATF3 expression could therefore modulate the efficiency of T cell priming against melanoma antigens.
Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and genes involved in telomere stabilization and Wnt-β-catenin signaling also function as immune modulators. [1] BRCA1-deficient tumors may exhibit increased genomic instability leading to higher neoantigen loads, while alterations in Wnt-β-catenin signaling are known to influence T cell exclusion from the tumor microenvironment.
Tissue-Specific and Cell-Type-Specific Effects
Multi-omic integration reveals that melanoma germline risk loci exert their effects through tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms. Analysis integrating epigenomic markers, three-dimensional genome organization, and eQTL data from melanoma-relevant tissues identified 151 target genes—both proximal and distal to risk loci—with roles in melanoma etiology. [7] These target genes interact with known melanoma driver genes through protein-protein interaction networks and participate in tissue-specific gene regulatory networks that connect melanoma to its comorbidities. [7]
TIME eQTLs are enriched in specific immune cell subsets, with particular relevance to macrophages and dendritic cells. [6] This cell-type specificity suggests that germline variants may preferentially affect myeloid compartments of the immune microenvironment, which are critical regulators of both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity.
Clinical Implications and Therapeutic Relevance
Polygenic risk scores built with TIME eQTLs can stratify patients for immune checkpoint blockade response, demonstrating the clinical utility of germline immune modulators.
[6] Validation of this approach was demonstrated through CTSS (cathepsin S) inhibition, a gene implicated by cancer risk and ICB response-associated polygenic models; CTSS inhibition resulted in slowed tumor growth and extended survival in vivo. [6]
The high prevalence of germline variants in DNA damage repair genes among melanoma patients (particularly CHEK2, identified in 12.5% of mucosal melanoma cases) suggests potential therapeutic opportunities. [8] These variants may predict enhanced responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors due to increased mutational burden and neoantigen presentation, though this hypothesis requires prospective validation.
Germline testing in melanoma reveals actionable findings in 10.6% to 15.8% of patients, with implications extending beyond melanoma risk to include screening for associated malignancies such as pancreatic cancer (associated with CDKN2A variants) and breast/ovarian cancer (associated with BRCA1/2 variants).

Variants in CTLA4, PDCD1 (PD-1), and CD274 (PD-L1) influence T-cell inhibition and melanoma progression or immunotherapy response [2–4]. The CCR5-Δ32 deletion decreases effector T-cell trafficking into tumors, shaping a “cold” immune microenvironment and reducing immunotherapy benefit [8]. IRF5 autoimmune-associated variants enhance type I interferon signaling and promote a more pro-inflammatory tumor milieu [5]. APOE alleles modulate the myeloid and lymphoid composition of melanoma, with APOE4 promoting stronger anti-tumor immunity and APOE2 supporting an immunosuppressive microenvironment [1]. Tumor-expressed signaling variants with germline origins, such as FGFR4 Arg388 and KDR Q472H, increase STAT3 activation or VEGF-driven angiogenesis, respectively, producing immune-evasive tumor niches [6–7]. Finally, a regulatory variant reducing TREX1 expression enhances cGAS-STING activation, increasing intratumoral immune infiltration and responsiveness to checkpoint blockade [9].

1. Immune Checkpoint Variants (CTLA4, PDCD1, CD274)
Germline CTLA4 variants correlate with response to CTLA-4 blockade in metastatic melanoma and influence long-term survival, likely by modifying CTLA-4 inhibitory signaling on T cells and altering activation thresholds [2].
Variants in PDCD1 (PD-1) modify PD-1 expression and T-cell exhaustion states, correlating with immunotherapy outcomes; for example, carriers of specific PD-1 SNPs exhibit improved survival under PD-1 blockade due to reduced inhibitory signaling [3].
Germline variation in CD274 (PD-L1) affects PD-L1 expression and correlates with thicker primary melanomas, indicating enhanced baseline immune suppression within the tumor [4].

2. Chemokine Receptor Variant (CCR5-Δ32)
The CCR5-Δ32 variant truncates CCR5 and reduces T-cell recruitment to tumors. Melanoma patients carrying this deletion show poorer survival during immunotherapy, reflecting decreased CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration into tumors and a less inflamed microenvironment [8].

3. Innate Immune Modulators (IRF5)
IRF5 polymorphisms associated with autoimmunity also correlate with improved melanoma outcomes, especially in patients who develop immune-related adverse events. Mechanistically, IRF5 risk alleles increase type I interferon responses and promote a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment characterized by activated dendritic cells and M1-like macrophages [5].

4. Lipid Metabolism Variants Shaping Immune Milieu (APOE)
APOE isoforms have strong effects on melanoma progression through immune modulation.
– APOE4 increases CD8⁺ T-cell and NK-cell infiltration and reduces suppressive macrophage populations.
– APOE2 supports pro-tumor macrophage polarization, angiogenesis, and immune escape.
Human and mouse studies demonstrate that APOE genotype fundamentally alters the inflammatory composition of melanoma, affecting survival [1].

5. Tumor Signaling Variants with Immune Consequences (FGFR4 Arg388; KDR Q472H)
The FGFR4 Arg388 variant increases STAT3 activation, driving immunosuppressive cytokine production and reducing T-cell infiltration in melanoma. Clinically, Arg388 correlates with increased tumor thickness and poorer patient outcomes [6].
The KDR Q472H variant heightens VEGFR-2 activity, promoting angiogenesis and immunosuppressive cytokine environments. Tumors from Q472H carriers show rapid growth and reduced immune infiltration, leading to inferior immunotherapy responses [7].

6. Innate DNA Sensing Modulators (TREX1 eQTL)
A germline eQTL variant reducing TREX1 expression permits cytosolic DNA accumulation in tumors, activating cGAS-STING signaling. This increases type I interferons, dendritic-cell recruitment, and T-cell infiltration. Carriers exhibit higher response rates to checkpoint blockade, demonstrating how germline regulation of DNA sensing can tune tumor immunogenicity [9].","Ostendorf, B. N., et al. (2020).

Nature Communications, 14, 2744.","Germline variants in genes such as APOE, PRKCD, and those in the IL10 locus modulate the melanoma immune microenvironment (TME), primarily by altering immune cell phenotypes, cytokine expression, and T-cell infiltration, which impacts disease progression and response to immunotherapy. These host genetic factors influence the intrinsic immune profile of a patient and the subsequent development of an anti-tumor immune response. 

The immune response in melanoma patients is significantly modulated by inherited germline genetic variations, which consequently impact disease progression and survival. These variants affect the TME through several mechanisms, including altering gene expression, influencing immune cell states, and affecting the somatic mutational landscape. 
Key Germline Variants and Mechanisms
APOE (Apolipoprotein E): Common germline variants of the APOE gene significantly impact melanoma outcomes.
APOE4 variant: Confers favorable outcomes and improved survival in melanoma patients compared to APOE2 carriers. Its mechanism involves enhancing anti-tumor immune activation, increasing T-cell infiltration into the TME. Mice with the human APOE4 variant show reduced melanoma progression. It also improves outcomes under PD1 checkpoint blockade.
APOE2 variant: Associated with poor outcomes and reduced survival. It promotes melanoma progression through a gain-of-function role mediated by the LRP1 receptor, which stimulates protein synthesis in tumor cells.
APOE genotype influences the differentiation and function of immune cells, with the APOE4 variant leading to a more robust anti-tumor immune response.
PKCδ (Protein Kinase C delta, encoded by PRKCD): Certain PRKCD germline variants are associated with the tumor immune gene signature.
Mechanism: Genetic deletion of Prkcd in mice improves endogenous anti-tumor immunity and increases the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy. This is achieved by causing a shift in macrophage gene expression from an M2-like (pro-tumorigenic) to an M1-like (anti-tumorigenic) phenotype within the TME. Analysis of human clinical samples confirms an association between PRKCD variants and the M1/M2 phenotype.
Interleukin 10 (IL10) Locus: The rs3024493 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the IL10 locus at chromosome 1q32.1 is associated with melanoma overall survival.
Mechanism: This variant is linked with the downregulation of interleukin 10 (IL10) secretion in CD4+ T cells. A lower level of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL10 may enhance the anti-tumor immune response, leading to improved outcomes.
DNA Repair Genes (CDKN2A, CDK4, ATM, POLH, MRE11A, RECQL4, XPC): Pathogenic germline mutations in these DNA repair genes affect cancer risk and prognosis.
Mechanism: Mutations in DNA-repair genes can cause the accumulation of somatic alterations by increasing genomic instability, which in turn facilitates the development of neoepitope-mediated tumor rejection. However, some studies found that carriers of these pathogenic germline variants had worse overall survival, possibly due to a lower tumor mutation burden in certain contexts.
CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4): Polymorphisms in the CTLA-4 gene have been reported to affect the response to CTLA-4 blockade immunotherapy in melanoma patients.
ERAP2 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 2): This gene is a pan-cancer type expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), meaning germline variants influence its expression.
Mechanism: ERAP2 is involved in antigen presentation. Germline variants affecting ERAP2 expression can influence immune phenotypes and potentially the efficacy of immunotherapy by altering how tumor antigens are presented to T cells. 
These findings suggest that a patient's germline background is a critical determinant of the intrinsic immune landscape of the tumor and a potential biomarker for predicting response to immunotherapy.

57,Melanoma,How does gut microbiome regulate immune microenvironment of melanoma? What does it modulate the response to immunotherapy?,Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER: The gut microbiome regulates the immune microenvironment of melanoma by influencing the recruitment and function of key immune cells within the tumor. Specific gut bacteria, such as *Bifidobacterium*, augment dendritic cell function, leading to enhanced priming and accumulation of antitumor CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (PMID:26541606). Similarly, distinct *Bacteroides* species are essential for T cell responses that mediate the antitumor effects of certain immunotherapies (PMID:26541610). The composition of the gut microbiota directly modulates the response to immunotherapy in melanoma patients. A diverse and favorable microbiome, often associated with a high-fiber diet, is linked to improved efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies (PMID:34941392). Specific bacterial species such as *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*, *Bifidobacterium adolescentis*, *Bacteroides caccae*, and *Eubacterium rectale* have been associated with positive clinical responses to ICIs (PMID:36809182; PMID:28923537). Conversely, an unfavorable microbiome or the use of antibiotics can impair immunotherapy efficacy (PMID:26541610). Therapeutic interventions like Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) from responding patients have been shown to overcome resistance to immunotherapy in non-responding melanoma patients by favorably altering the gut microbiota, which in turn remodels the tumor immune microenvironment, increasing CD8+ T cell activity and promoting clinical benefit (PMID:33542131; PMID:33303685).

ANALYSIS:
### **1. The Gut Microbiome and Its Role in Human Health**

The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of approximately 10^14 microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, residing in the intestinal tract (PMID:28388917). Bacteria are the most studied component, with Gram-positive Firmicutes and Gram-negative Bacteroidetes being the predominant groups (PMID:28388917). The gut microbiota is integral to host health, contributing to the biosynthesis of vitamins and essential amino acids, and the generation of metabolic byproducts like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from undigested dietary components (PMID:28388917). These SCFAs, such as butyrate, propionate, and acetate, serve as a major energy source for intestinal epithelial cells, strengthening the mucosal barrier (PMID:28388917). The gut microbiome also plays a critical role in immune system development, metabolism, and behavior (PMID:26449893; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_microbiota).

The composition of the gut microbiome is dynamic and can be influenced by various factors, including age, environment, stress, medication, and most notably, diet (PMID:26449893; PMID:28388917). Dietary alterations can induce significant microbial shifts within 24 hours (PMID:28388917). Diets high in fiber, unsaturated fatty acids, and polyphenols are associated with health, whereas ultra-processed foods rich in saturated fats, salt, and refined carbohydrates can have negative consequences (PMID:36375468; PMID:38388570). Fermented foods can also affect the gut microbiome in both the short and long term (PMID:35406140).

An imbalance in the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, is associated with a wide range of chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders (PMID:32887946; PMID:28388917; PMID:30994937). For instance, IBD patients often exhibit less bacterial diversity, which may contribute to reduced concentrations of anti-inflammatory butyrate (PMID:28388917). In type 2 diabetes, dysbiosis can reshape intestinal barrier functions and host metabolic pathways, contributing to insulin resistance (PMID:30366260). The gut mycobiome (fungi) is also a crucial component, regulating host homeostasis and interacting with the bacterial microbiome and host immunity (PMID:36182668). As research advances, there is growing interest in microbiota-centered therapies like probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to modulate the gut microbiome for therapeutic benefit (PMID:39378879; PMID:39599742).

### **2. The Immune Microenvironment in Melanoma**

Melanoma is a highly immunogenic form of skin cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma; PMID:31404607). Its immunogenic nature makes it a prime candidate for immunotherapy (PMID:31404607). The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem surrounding the tumor, comprising cancer cells, stromal cells, immune cells, and the extracellular matrix (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_microenvironment). The constant interaction between cancer cells and the TME supports tumor growth, invasion, and resistance to treatments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_microenvironment).

Despite their immunogenicity, melanomas develop various mechanisms to suppress innate and adaptive immune responses, allowing them to evade detection and destruction (PMID:31404607). For example, tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can reshape the immune microenvironment by carrying immunosuppressive cargo that prevents antitumor immune responses (PMID:36244269). Understanding these immune evasion mechanisms is critical for overcoming resistance to immunotherapy, which can be either primary (no initial response) or acquired (relapse after an initial response) (PMID:29127120). Effective therapeutic strategies aim to coordinately activate tumor-specific immunity while increasing the recognition and accessibility of melanoma cells (PMID:31404607).

### **3. General Interactions Between the Gut Microbiome and the Immune System**

The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in the development, maturation, and function of the host immune system (PMID:33803407; PMID:28965190). A significant portion of the body's immune cells, approximately 70-80%, resides in the gut, highlighting the intricate interplay between the microbiota, the intestinal epithelial layer, and the mucosal immune system (PMID:33803407). This relationship is symbiotic; the microbiome educates the immune system, while the immune system helps maintain host-microbe symbiosis (PMID:36271581).

Microbial signals are crucial for both local and systemic immunity (PMID:30976087). For instance, metabolites produced by commensal microbes, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are recognized by the immune system and influence numerous metabolic and immune pathways (PMID:36758518; PMID:33803407). Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiota, is correlated with various autoimmune, metabolic, and inflammatory diseases, as it can disrupt the intestinal barrier and alter immune homeostasis (PMID:28965190; PMID:28956703). The influence of the gut microbiome extends beyond the gut via pathways like the gut-lung and gut-muscle axes, where microbial components can affect immune responses and physiological processes in distant organs (PMID:30976087; PMID:30753131). The establishment of this crucial host-microbe relationship begins in early life and is shaped by factors like maternal immunity, mode of birth, and diet (PMID:38097774; PMID:37138015).

### **4. Gut Microbiome's Influence on the Melanoma Immune Microenvironment**

The gut microbiome directly influences the immune microenvironment of melanoma, thereby affecting spontaneous antitumor immunity and the response to treatment.

- A study using mouse models demonstrated that differences in commensal microbiota led to variations in spontaneous antitumor immunity against melanoma. These differences were eliminated by cohousing mice or through fecal transfer, indicating a direct role of the microbiota (PMID:26541606). The study identified *Bifidobacterium* as a key genus associated with antitumor effects. Oral administration of *Bifidobacterium* improved tumor control by augmenting dendritic cell function, which in turn enhanced the priming and accumulation of CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment (PMID:26541606).

- The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting CTLA-4 was found to be dependent on distinct *Bacteroides* species. In both mice and melanoma patients, T cell responses specific to *B. thetaiotaomicron* or *B. fragilis* were associated with the effectiveness of CTLA-4 blockade (PMID:26541610). In germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice, tumors did not respond to anti-CTLA-4 therapy. This lack of response was reversed by introducing *B. fragilis*, indicating its crucial role in modulating the immune microenvironment to favor an antitumor response (PMID:26541610).

- Dietary habits that shape the gut microbiota also impact the tumor microenvironment. In a study of melanoma patients receiving ICB, higher dietary fiber intake was associated with improved progression-free survival (PMID:34941392). In corresponding preclinical models, mice on a low-fiber diet showed an impaired response to anti-PD-1 therapy and had a lower frequency of interferon-γ–positive cytotoxic T cells in the tumor microenvironment (PMID:34941392).

- Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been shown to modulate the tumor immune microenvironment in melanoma patients. A clinical trial involving patients with anti-PD-1-refractory melanoma found that FMT from responding donors led to clinical responses in some patients. This was accompanied by favorable changes in immune cell infiltrates and gene expression profiles within both the gut and the tumor microenvironment (PMID:33303685). Another trial confirmed these findings, showing that responder-derived FMT increased the abundance of beneficial taxa and CD8+ T cell activity in patients with PD-1-refractory melanoma (PMID:33542131).

### **5. Mechanisms of Immune Modulation by the Gut Microbiome**

The gut microbiome modulates host immune responses through several interconnected mechanisms.

- **Immune Homeostasis and Barrier Function:** The gut microbiota is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. It competes with pathogens for resources, a mechanism known as colonization resistance, and produces metabolites like SCFAs that enhance the integrity of the gut barrier (PMID:33803407; PMID:28856738). A healthy mucosal immune system surveils the microbiota, and any dysbiosis can lead to inflammation, disrupt the intestinal barrier, and cause immunity dysfunction (PMID:28465831; PMID:28956703).

- **Metabolite Production:** Gut microbiota-derived metabolites are critical regulators of immune cell responses. These metabolites can influence the activation and function of T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, thereby affecting both local and systemic immunity (PMID:33707689; PMID:33803407).

- **Innate and Adaptive Immune Signaling:** The microbiome integrates environmental cues, such as diet, with host genetic and immune signals (PMID:27383981). It provides signals necessary for the proper development and function of the immune system. For instance, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) acts as a sensor for environmental, dietary, and microbial signals, controlling transcriptional programs that influence immune responses, particularly in the gut (PMID:30718831).

### **6. Gut Microbiome's Impact on Melanoma Immunotherapy**

Accumulating evidence strongly suggests that the gut microbiota is a key modulator of the efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapies, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in melanoma treatment (PMID:34453999).

- **Modulation of ICI Efficacy:** The composition of a patient's microbiome has been shown to influence the response to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapies (PMID:29302014; PMID:34190675). Several bacterial species have been associated with enhanced efficacy of ICIs (PMID:32792462). For example, a study identified *Bifidobacterium* as being associated with antitumor effects, where its administration alone improved tumor control to a degree similar to anti-PD-L1 therapy. The combination of both nearly abolished tumor outgrowth in mouse models of melanoma (PMID:26541606). Another study found that the antitumor effects of CTLA-4 blockade depended on *Bacteroides* species, which were associated with specific T cell responses (PMID:26541610).

- **Therapeutic Interventions:** The gut microbiome's influence on immunotherapy has led to research into modulating it to improve clinical outcomes. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as a promising strategy. A phase I trial combining healthy donor FMT with anti-PD-1 inhibitors in previously untreated advanced melanoma patients reported an objective response rate of 65% (PMID:37414899). Responders showed successful engraftment of donor strains and an enrichment of immunogenic bacteria (PMID:37414899).

- **Influence of Other Microbes:** The microbiome is not limited to bacteria. One study found that intestinal fungi can also regulate antitumor immune responses. In mouse models of melanoma and breast cancer, antibiotic-mediated depletion of fungi enhanced responsiveness to radiation therapy, whereas depletion of bacteria reduced responsiveness and was associated with an overgrowth of commensal fungi (PMID:34329585). This suggests a complex interplay between different microbial kingdoms in modulating cancer therapy responses.

### **7. Pathways Linking the Gut Microbiome to Immunotherapy Outcomes**

The gut microbiome influences immunotherapy outcomes by modulating the host's systemic immune response, which in turn affects the tumor immune microenvironment.

- **Enhancing T Cell Response:** A key mechanism is the enhancement of antitumor T cell activity. In a study on melanoma patients, a high-fiber diet, which promotes a healthy microbiome, was associated with improved progression-free survival on ICB. This was linked to a higher frequency of interferon-γ–positive cytotoxic T cells in the TME (PMID:34941392). The administration of *Bifidobacterium* in mice led to augmented dendritic cell function, resulting in enhanced CD8+ T cell priming and accumulation in tumors (PMID:26541606). Similarly, *Bacteroides fragilis* was shown to be crucial for generating specific T cell responses required for the efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 therapy (PMID:26541610).

- **Remodeling the Tumor Microenvironment via FMT:** Fecal microbiota transplantation from responders to non-responders has been shown to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients. This intervention induces rapid and durable changes in the recipient's microbiota, leading to increased abundance of beneficial bacterial taxa (PMID:33542131). This microbial shift is associated with favorable changes in immune cell infiltrates and gene expression profiles within the tumor microenvironment, ultimately leading to clinical benefit (PMID:33303685).

- **Metabolic Influence:** The gut microbiome's metabolic output also plays a role. A multi-omics analysis of patients on anti-PD-1 therapy identified microbial and metabolic signatures associated with treatment response. The study identified five response-associated enterotypes, each linked to specific bacteria and metabolites. One metabolite, phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), was negatively correlated with response and was shown to attenuate anti-PD-1 efficacy in vivo, highlighting the direct impact of microbial metabolites on immunotherapy outcomes (PMID:39909032).

### **8. Specific Microbial Species and Metabolites in Melanoma Immunomodulation**

Research has identified specific bacterial species and metabolites that are associated with the response to immunotherapy in melanoma.

- A meta-analysis of seven studies on melanoma patients identified three bacterial species as cross-study taxonomic biomarkers associated with a positive response to immunotherapy: *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*, *Bifidobacterium adolescentis*, and *Eubacterium rectale* (PMID:36809182). The same study also identified 101 groups of genes as functional biomarkers, including those involved in producing immune-stimulating molecules (PMID:36809182).

- Another prospective study in metastatic melanoma patients found that responders to ICI therapy were enriched for *Bacteroides caccae*. Among those responding to combination ipilimumab plus nivolumab, the microbiome was enriched for *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*, *Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron*, and *Holdemania filiformis*. Responders to pembrolizumab were enriched for *Dorea formicogenerans* (PMID:28923537). This study also used shotgun metabolomics to reveal high levels of anacardic acid in responders (PMID:28923537).

These findings underscore that specific microbial signatures can serve as potential biomarkers to predict ICI response and as targets for therapeutic interventions designed to enhance treatment efficacy (PMID:40588803).","1.

(PMID:33803407: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33803407)","The gut microbiome regulates the melanoma immune microenvironment through multiple mechanisms, including modulation of systemic and intratumoral T cell responses, production of immunomodulatory metabolites, and regulation of antigen presentation pathways. Specific commensal bacteria—particularly Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruminococcaceae species, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Bifidobacterium species—are consistently associated with enhanced response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) through promotion of interferon-γ-positive cytotoxic T cell infiltration, enhanced dendritic cell function, and enrichment of anabolic bacterial pathways. [1-4] Conversely, dysbiosis induced by antibiotics or dominated by Bacteroidaceae or Prevotella species correlates with primary resistance, shorter survival, and impaired antitumor immunity. [5-7]

Microbial Composition and ICI Response
Higher gut microbiome diversity and specific bacterial taxa are strongly associated with improved outcomes to ICI therapy in melanoma. In a landmark study of 112 melanoma patients receiving anti-PD-1 therapy, responders demonstrated significantly higher alpha diversity (P < 0.01) and relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae family bacteria (P < 0.01) compared to nonresponders. [4] Cross-cohort analyses integrating 165 ICI-naive patients with advanced melanoma across five observational cohorts confirmed that gut microbiome composition has a relevant but cohort-dependent association with response, with a panel of species including Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, Roseburia species, and Akkermansia muciniphila consistently enriched in responders, though no single species emerged as a universal biomarker. [3] Ruminococcaceae-dominated microbiomes are associated with higher response rates than Bacteroidaceae-dominated microbiomes. A prospective study of 103 trial patients from Australia and the Netherlands treated with neoadjuvant ICIs for high-risk resectable metastatic melanoma demonstrated geographically distinct microbial signatures, with overall response rates higher in Ruminococcaceae-dominated versus Bacteroidaceae-dominated microbiomes. [5] Machine learning analyses combining bacterial and fungal data achieved an AUC of 0.71 for predicting immunotherapy response, identifying Akkermansia, Romboutsia, and the fungus Rutstroemia as important biomarkers associated with responders, while Zancudomyces was associated with nonresponders. [8]
Mechanisms of Immune Modulation
Favorable gut microbiota enhances both systemic and intratumoral immunity through multiple pathways. Metagenomic studies revealed functional differences in gut bacteria of responders, including enrichment of anabolic pathways that support immune cell metabolism. [4] Immune profiling demonstrated enhanced systemic and antitumor immunity in responding patients with favorable gut microbiome composition, with mechanistic validation showing that germ-free mice receiving fecal transplants from responding patients exhibited improved response to anti-PD-1 therapy and increased intratumoral immune infiltrates compared to mice receiving transplants from nonresponders. [4][9] Microbial metabolites serve as key mediators of immune modulation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), tryptophan derivatives, and bile acids produced by commensal bacteria modulate epigenetic programs, G-protein-coupled receptor signaling, and oncogenic cascades including PI3K-AKT and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathways. [2] These metabolites can enhance immune responses to cancer cells, limit tumor growth, and promote the differentiation and function of regulatory and effector T cells. [2][7] Specific bacteria like Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii enhance antigen presentation and effector T cell activity, improving ICI efficacy. [2] The gut microbiome influences the frequency and phenotype of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Preclinical models demonstrated that mice receiving low-fiber diets or probiotics showed impaired response to anti-PD-1 therapy, with lower frequency of interferon-γ-positive cytotoxic T cells in the tumor microenvironment.
[10] This finding was corroborated in human studies where patients with favorable microbiomes exhibited increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and enhanced cytotoxic T cell responses. [4][9]
Dietary Influences on Microbiome-Immune Interactions
Higher dietary fiber intake is associated with significantly improved progression-free survival in melanoma patients receiving ICIs. In a study of 128 patients, sufficient dietary fiber intake without concurrent probiotic use conferred the most pronounced benefit, while poor response was associated with lower fiber and omega-3 fatty acid consumption and elevated baseline C-reactive protein. [5][10] The beneficial effect of dietary fiber appears mediated through promotion of SCFA-producing bacteria that enhance T cell responses, whereas commercial probiotic supplements may paradoxically impair ICI response by disrupting the native microbiome ecology. [10] Diet-driven microbial ecology underpins geographic variations in ICI outcomes. Integrated analyses across Australian, Dutch, and U.S. cohorts revealed that dietary patterns shape distinct microbial signatures associated with response and immune-related adverse events (irAEs), with fiber and omega-3 intake correlating with favorable microbiome composition. [5] These findings highlight the complex interplay between diet, microbiome, and systemic inflammation in determining ICI efficacy.
Antibiotic-Induced Dysbiosis and Treatment Resistance
Broad-spectrum antibiotic use prior to or during ICI therapy is consistently associated with worse outcomes. In an observational study of 196 cancer patients (including 38 with melanoma), those receiving antibiotics 30 days prior to ICI initiation had dramatically shorter overall survival compared to those without antibiotic exposure (2 vs 26 months; HR 7.4, 95% CI 4.2-12.9) and higher rates of disease progression (81% vs 44%, P < 0.001).
[6] A meta-analysis of 41,663 patients from 123 cohorts confirmed that antibiotic use around ICI initiation was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.47-1.76) and poorer progression-free survival (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.32-1.60). [6] Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis reduces microbial diversity and alters composition in ways that impair anti-PD-1 response. Lower microbial diversity and altered composition observed in patients receiving antibiotics during ICI treatment suggests that dysbiosis disrupts the beneficial bacteria-immune interactions necessary for effective checkpoint blockade. [9] However, the association may be confounded by the underlying health status necessitating antibiotic use. [9]
Microbiome-Immune-Related Adverse Events Relationships
The gut microbiome is associated with both ICI response and development of immune-related adverse events, though these outcomes can be de-correlated. Preliminary studies have shown associations between gut microbiome composition and treatment-related immune toxicity, particularly colitis, which is frequent with anti-CTLA-4 therapy. [9] In a prospective observational study, responders with irAEs showed enrichment of Bacteroides plebeius and Bacteroides coprophilus, whereas responders without irAEs had enrichment of Eubacterium siraeum, suggesting that specific microbial signatures may predict response independent of toxicity development. [11] An abundance of Bacteroides genus is associated with both response and irAE development. This dual association suggests that while Bacteroides-enriched microbiomes may enhance immune activation leading to tumor response, they may also predispose to immune-mediated toxicities. [11] Conversely, Eubacterium abundance may serve as a biomarker for response without irAEs, potentially identifying patients who will benefit from ICIs with lower toxicity risk. [11]
Bacterial-Fungal Interactions in Immunotherapy Response
Beyond bacteria, gut fungi and bacterial-fungal interactions play important roles in melanoma immunotherapy outcomes. Machine learning approaches revealed that combining bacterial and fungal data improved prediction of ICI response (AUC 0.71) compared to bacterial (AUC 0.64","[1] The Gut Microbiome and Cancer Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.

Journal of Clinical Oncology. 2023;41(Suppl 16):9569. doi:10.1200/JCO.2023.41.16_suppl.9569.","The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in shaping the anti-tumor immune microenvironment in melanoma, thereby influencing immunotherapy outcomes. Commensal bacteria can enhance local and systemic anti-melanoma immunity by promoting dendritic cell activation and T‐cell responses. In preclinical models, mice with a “favorable” gut microbiota (e.g. enriched in Bifidobacterium) showed increased tumor-infiltrating CD8⁺ T cells and stronger spontaneous anti-melanoma immunity, leading to slower tumor growth; cohousing or fecal transfer confirmed that these microbiota-driven immune effects were transferable【1】. Likewise, distinct commensal species are required for optimal checkpoint immunotherapy: CTLA-4 blockade efficacy in mice depends on Bacteroides species that stimulate Th1-polarized responses (via dendritic cell IL-12), and germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice fail to respond to anti-CTLA-4 unless their microbiota is restored【2】. Similarly, the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint therapy is boosted by certain gut bacteria (e.g. Bifidobacterium), which augment tumor-specific T cell activity【1】【2】.

Clinical evidence in melanoma patients mirrors these findings. Responders to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy often harbor higher gut microbiome diversity and specific beneficial taxa (such as Ruminococcaceae or Faecalibacterium spp.), whereas non-responders can have a less favorable composition【3】【4】. Importantly, a “favorable” microbiome is associated with a more inflamed tumor microenvironment – for example, patients with beneficial gut flora show increased intratumoral CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration and upregulated antigen presentation and effector T-cell genes in their tumors【3】. By contrast, an “unfavorable” microbiome (or disruption via broad-spectrum antibiotics) is linked to reduced T-cell responses and poorer checkpoint therapy outcomes【2】【3】.

Not only can the microbiome forecast treatment response, but it can also be therapeutically leveraged. Modulating the gut flora has been shown to improve immunotherapy efficacy. In fact, human pilot studies have demonstrated that transplanting fecal microbiota from melanoma immunotherapy responders into refractory patients can re-program the tumor microenvironment and restore responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy【5】. Patients receiving such responder-derived fecal transplants experienced enhanced T-cell activity and even tumor regression in some cases【5】. In summary, the gut microbiome critically regulates melanoma immunity by shaping the tumor’s immune milieu (e.g. T-cell infiltration and cytokine profile) and modulates the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapies, with specific commensal bacteria promoting an immune-responsive, anti-tumor microenvironment that improves immunotherapy outcomes【1】【2】【3】【5】.

The interaction between the gut microbiome and the host immune system is now recognized as a key factor in melanoma progression and therapy response. Research indicates that gut microbes can “educate” the immune system and thereby influence the immune contexture within the tumor. Mechanistically, commensal bacteria provide microbial antigens and metabolites that drive maturation of antigen-presenting cells and bias T lymphocytes towards a tumor-fighting phenotype. For example, Sivan et al. (2015) showed that genetically identical mice from different vendors (with distinct gut flora) had markedly different melanoma growth rates; mice harboring Bifidobacterium-rich microbiota mounted stronger spontaneous anti-tumor T cell responses and had more CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration in tumors【1】. By reconstituting the microbiota of poor responders with Bifidobacterium, tumor control improved to the level of checkpoint therapy alone【1】. This provided proof that certain microbes can enhance anti-melanoma immunity by creating a more favorable immune microenvironment. Concurrently, Vétizou et al. (2015) demonstrated that efficacy of CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade absolutely required an intact gut microbiome【2】. They found that mice lacking commensals (germ-free or antibiotic-treated) did not respond to anti-CTLA-4 therapy, whereas introduction of specific Bacteroides species restored treatment response【2】. These bacteria induced dendritic cell maturation and IL-12 production, promoting a TH1/cytotoxic immune milieu in the tumor that was necessary for tumor rejection【2】. Notably, melanoma patients responding to ipilimumab (CTLA-4 blocker) were found to have circulating T cells reactive to these same Bacteroides antigens, underscoring how gut microbes shape systemic anti-tumor immunity【2】.

Translational studies in humans have reinforced these concepts. Gopalakrishnan et al. (2018) profiled the gut microbiome in melanoma patients on anti-PD-1 therapy and observed that responders had significantly higher microbial diversity and enrichment of immunostimulatory commensals【3】. These responders’ tumors exhibited a “hot” immune microenvironment characterized by greater infiltration of CD8⁺ cytotoxic T cells and elevated expression of genes related to antigen presentation and T-cell effector function【3】. In contrast, non-responders had a less diverse microbiome (sometimes dominated by potential opportunists) and a “cold” tumor microenvironment with fewer tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes【3】. Similarly, Matson et al. (2018) identified distinct gut bacterial signatures associated with melanoma patients’ responsiveness to PD-1 blockade【4】. They found that the presence of certain taxa (including Bifidobacterium longum, Collinsella aerofaciens, and Enterococcus faecium) was correlated with clinical response, and crucially, they demonstrated causality by transferring patient microbiota into germ-free mice【4】. Mice colonized with stool from responders showed enhanced anti-tumor T cell activity and controlled melanoma growth upon checkpoint therapy, whereas those receiving non-responder microbiota failed to reject tumors【4】. This confirms that gut microbiota composition can directly modulate the effectiveness of immunotherapy, largely by regulating anti-tumor immune surveillance. Consistently, multiple cohorts have reported that antibiotic exposure (which perturbs the gut flora) shortly before or during immunotherapy is associated with worse outcomes in melanoma patients, further implicating the microbiome’s role in priming effective anti-tumor immunity【3】.

Beyond correlation, emerging clinical interventions highlight microbiome modulation as a viable strategy to improve melanoma treatment. A landmark fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) trial in 2021 provided proof-of-concept that altering the gut microbiome can overcome resistance to immunotherapy【5】. In this study, patients with advanced melanoma who had not responded to anti-PD-1 therapy received FMT from donors who were immunotherapy responders, followed by re-initiation of anti-PD-1 treatment【5】. A subset of these previously resistant patients subsequently showed tumor regression or disease stabilization, accompanied by increased abundance of favorable gut bacteria from the donor and immunological changes. Post-FMT biopsies revealed heightened CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration and reduced immunosuppressive cell populations in the tumor microenvironment of responders【5】. These results underscore that a beneficial microbiome can causatively remodel the tumor immune microenvironment to a more inflamed, anti-tumor state, thereby potentiating the effects of checkpoint inhibitors. Conversely, an unfavorable microbiome may fail to provide necessary immune stimulation or may even skew immunity towards pro-tumor tolerance (for instance, via metabolite profiles that induce regulatory T cells or myeloid suppressors), though the exact suppressive mechanisms remain under investigation.

In summary, robust evidence from animal models to human trials indicates that gut microbiota critically regulate the melanoma immune microenvironment — influencing the infiltration and activity of immune cells within tumors — and thereby modulate patients’ responses to immunotherapies. Commensal microbes that promote dendritic cell recruitment, Th1 polarization, and cytotoxic T-cell priming in the tumor milieu are associated with improved anti-melanoma immunity and higher likelihood of benefit from therapies like PD-1 or CTLA-4 blockers【2】【3】. On the other hand, loss of key commensals can blunt anti-tumor immune surveillance. Harnessing this knowledge, interventions targeting the microbiome (dietary measures, probiotics, avoiding deleterious antibiotics, or FMT) are now being explored as adjuvants to tip the balance toward a more immune-reactive tumor microenvironment in melanoma. Ultimately, the gut microbiome emerges as a fundamental regulator of melanoma immunology and a modulator of immunotherapy efficacy, offering a novel lever to improve cancer treatment outcomes【3】【5】.","Sivan, A., Corrales, L., Hubert, N., Williams, J.

Science, 371(6529), 595–602.","The gut microbiome significantly regulates the immune microenvironment of melanoma by influencing both local and systemic immunity through various mechanisms, including the production of metabolites, direct immune cell modulation, and molecular mimicry. A diverse and specific gut microbiota composition can enhance anti-tumor immune responses, thereby modulating and often improving the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. 

The gut microbiota influences melanoma and the response to immunotherapy through a complex interplay involving the immune system and microbial-derived metabolites. 
Regulation of the Immune Microenvironment
The gut microbiome modulates the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) in both pro- and anti-tumorigenic ways. 
Immune Cell Modulation: The gut microbiota is essential for the maturation and function of various immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and T lymphocytes. Beneficial commensals can promote the activation of M1 macrophages and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are crucial for recognizing and eliminating tumor cells. Conversely, dysbiosis (an imbalance in the microbial community) can lead to the expansion of immunosuppressive cells within the TME, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which inhibit anti-tumor immune responses.
Cytokine and Signaling Pathway Regulation: Microbes and their components (e.g., lipopolysaccharide/LPS) can engage pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on immune and epithelial cells, triggering signaling pathways such as NF-κB and influencing the balance of pro-inflammatory (IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α) versus anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines.
Metabolite Production: Microbial metabolites play a key role in systemic immune regulation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, propionate, and acetate, produced by beneficial bacteria, act as important epigenetic regulators (histone deacetylase inhibitors) and G-protein coupled receptor ligands, influencing gene expression in immune and tumor cells and enhancing antigen presentation. Other metabolites, such as inosine, kynurenine, and secondary bile acids, can activate or suppress immune cells and signaling pathways, directly impacting the TME.
Gut Barrier Integrity: The microbiota helps maintain the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Disruption of this barrier can lead to bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation, which may favor tumor progression or influence the risk of immune-related adverse events during therapy. 
Modulation of Immunotherapy Response
The composition and diversity of the gut microbiome are significant determinants of the clinical response to ICIs in melanoma patients. 
Favorable Microbiota Profiles: Patients who respond well to anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 therapy often exhibit higher gut microbial diversity and enrichment of specific bacterial taxa, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Akkermansia muciniphila, and members of the Ruminococcaceae and Bifidobacterium genera. These favorable profiles are associated with enhanced dendritic cell activation, increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the tumor, and robust Th1-type immune responses.
Unfavorable Microbiota Profiles: Conversely, non-responders typically show lower diversity and a higher abundance of other bacteria, such as Bacteroidales. These communities are often linked to a more immunosuppressive phenotype within the TME.
Molecular Mimicry: Some bacterial proteins can mimic tumor antigens, leading to cross-reactivity and the activation of T cells that then target cancer cells, thereby enhancing the efficacy of ICIs.
Therapeutic Interventions: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from responders to non-responders in clinical trials has successfully restored anti-tumor immunity and improved clinical outcomes in a subset of advanced melanoma patients resistant to PD-1 blockade. Prebiotics and specific probiotics are also under investigation to modulate the gut microbiota composition and enhance anti-melanoma immunity. ","Baruch, E.

58,Melanoma,What determines the difference in the melanoma incidence among human races?,Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER: The difference in melanoma incidence among human races is primarily determined by the degree of skin pigmentation, which dictates the level of natural protection against ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Individuals with darker skin have higher levels of eumelanin, a pigment that effectively absorbs and scatters UV radiation, thereby reducing UV-induced DNA damage in skin cells and resulting in a significantly lower incidence of melanoma compared to fair-skinned individuals. While UV exposure is the predominant environmental risk factor for melanoma, its role is most pronounced in fair-skinned populations; the association is less certain and often not supported by evidence for people with skin of color. Genetic factors also play a crucial role, with specific genes like MC1R influencing pigmentation and DNA repair capacity, and other susceptibility genes like CDKN2A contributing to risk. However, the overall difference in melanoma burden is compounded by a complex interplay of non-biological factors linked to race as a social construct. These include disparities in socioeconomic status, healthcare access and quality, cultural practices related to sun exposure, and the effectiveness of public health campaigns, which are often not tailored to communities of color. Consequently, while people of color have a lower incidence of melanoma, they frequently experience delayed diagnosis, presentation at more advanced stages (e.g., acral lentiginous melanoma in non-sun-exposed areas), and worse survival outcomes, highlighting a critical disparity where biological advantage is negated by systemic and social factors.

ANALYSIS: 
**1. Introduction: Defining Melanoma and the Concept of Race**

**1.1. Definition of Melanoma**
Melanoma is a form of cancer that originates from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin pigment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma). While it is most commonly a type of skin cancer, it can, in rare instances, develop in other parts of the body such as the mouth, intestines, or eyes. Even more rarely, primary pulmonary melanoma can occur in the lungs, accounting for only 0.01% of primary lung tumors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma).

**1.2. Understanding Human Race in Health Research**
Modern science defines ""race"" as a social construct rather than a biological reality. It is a system for categorizing humans based on perceived shared physical or social characteristics, which has historically been used to justify racism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)). In dermatological and biomedical research, the term ""people with skin of color"" is used to encompass a wide range of racial and ethnic groups, including those of African, Asian, Native American, and Hispanic descent (PMID:11807469). Studies have shown that while there are some biological differences, such as epidermal melanin content, these do not form a distinct biological basis for race (PMID:11807469; PMID:26619959). The casual use of ""race"" in research can obscure the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and social factors that contribute to health disparities (PMID:17519124). Sociological research emphasizes that racial inequalities in health are primarily driven by social structures, context, and the effects of racism, rather than inherent biological differences (PMID:20943580). Furthermore, the vast majority of genetic research, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), has been conducted on populations of European ancestry, creating a significant bias that limits the applicability of findings to diverse global populations (PMID:30901543; PMID:31217584).

**2. Core Determinants of Melanoma Incidence Disparities**

**2.1. The Role of Skin Pigmentation**
The degree of skin pigmentation is a primary factor influencing melanoma incidence. A clear negative correlation exists between the level of skin pigmentation and the incidence of melanoma on sun-exposed body sites (PMID:475965). The pigment melanin, particularly eumelanin, provides protection against UV radiation (PMID:475965). The individual typology angle (°ITA), a colorimetric classification of skin, correlates significantly with UV sensitivity and the extent of UV-induced DNA damage, explaining the higher risk for lighter skin types (PMID:24098899). Consequently, non-white populations generally have a much lower incidence of melanoma (PMID:475965), and the risk of uveal (eye) melanoma is exceptionally low in Black individuals (PMID:9627661). However, despite the lower incidence, people of color often present with more advanced-stage disease and have worse survival rates (PMID:24485530; PMID:27476974; PMID:23795952; PMID:19691228). This is partly due to different clinical presentations, with melanoma subtypes like acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) and mucosal melanoma being more common in individuals with skin of color (SOC) (PMID:35533771).

**2.2. Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation Exposure**
UV radiation is the most significant environmental risk factor for developing melanoma, especially in fair-skinned populations (PMID:19464592). The degree of skin pigmentation mediates the harmful effects of sun exposure (PMID:24098899). However, the role of UV exposure in melanoma development among people of color is less clear. A systematic review found that most studies do not support UV exposure as a major risk factor for melanoma in these populations, though the quality of evidence was noted to be moderate to low (PMID:33325988). Conversely, some research suggests that exposure to solar radiation does play a role in both Hispanic and Black populations. One study found a statistically significant correlation between melanoma and the UV index for Black males (PMID:15262692), and another estimated that the relative risk of melanoma mortality for Black males increased with higher UVB exposure (PMID:10750668). Another ecological study, however, found a significant association between UV index and melanoma incidence only in non-Hispanic whites, with no evidence for the same association in Black or Hispanic populations (PMID:15837865).

**2.3. Genetic Factors**
Melanoma is a complex cancer influenced by both rare high-risk susceptibility genes and common polymorphic genes (PMID:19464592). Specific genetic mutations in genes like *KRAS*, *NRAS*, *BRAF*, *CDKN2A*, and *BRCA2* are implicated in its development (PMID:40447784). The observation that melanoma subtypes in non-European populations are often not associated with UV exposure suggests that different genetic and environmental pathways may be involved in these groups (PMID:28450704). For instance, acral lentiginous melanoma, which is more common in people of color, is associated with worse survival rates, hinting at underlying genetic and biological differences (PMID:19380664). Race- and gender-dependent differences in melanoma incidence further suggest that genetic factors contribute significantly, particularly to early-onset melanomas (PMID:30871230). The need for more genetic studies in diverse populations is critical to understanding these variations (PMID:35809800).

**3. Sociodemographic and Systemic Factors**

**3.1. Socioeconomic Status (SES)**
Socioeconomic factors, including income, education level, and insurance coverage, significantly influence melanoma presentation and outcomes across racial groups (PMID:21080042). Patients with lower SES are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced melanomas (PMID:23968545; PMID:34676795). Studies show that while melanoma incidence has been increasing across all SES levels in light-skinned populations, the largest relative increases were among males in the lowest SES neighborhoods (PMID:28736233). Although melanoma incidence is higher in whites, survival rates are significantly lower for non-white patients, a disparity linked in part to socioeconomic barriers that impede timely diagnosis and treatment (PMID:27476974; PMID:34676795).

**3.2. Healthcare Access and Quality**
Disparities in healthcare access and quality contribute significantly to racial differences in melanoma outcomes. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients with cutaneous malignancies are more likely than non-Hispanic White patients to delay primary care visits due to cost or lack of transportation (PMID:39400730). Factors such as lower socioeconomic status, lack of insurance, and rural residence are associated with decreased access to dermatologists, leading to detection of melanomas at a later, more dangerous stage (PMID:32783908; PMID:33516743; PMID:31462069). Non-Hispanic Black individuals, in particular, are diagnosed at later stages more frequently, contributing to poorer survival rates, which underscores a need for better awareness among both patients and providers (PMID:31228233). Even in universal healthcare systems, populations with lower SES face an increased risk of advanced melanoma at diagnosis, highlighting persistent inequities in care (PMID:32955341). These widespread and persistent racial and ethnic disparities are the result of complex interactions between social disadvantage, clinician factors, and systemic issues (PMID:26789384).

**3.3. Public Health Policies and Awareness**
Public health policies and awareness campaigns can impact melanoma incidence and outcomes, but their effectiveness varies across racial groups. Many individuals, particularly those in Latinx and Black communities, are unfamiliar with melanoma, perceive darker skin as conferring low risk, and are unaware that melanoma can occur in non-sun-exposed areas like palms and soles (PMID:36433634; PMID:36631232). This indicates a critical need for public health messages tailored to these communities to promote early detection and address barriers to care, such as healthcare costs (PMID:36433634). The increasing incidence of melanoma across all stages and SES groups suggests that the rise is a true increase in occurrence, not just an artifact of better detection, reinforcing the need for effective public health interventions (PMID:28736233).

**4. Lifestyle, Environmental, and Biological Factors**

**4.1. Cultural Practices and Lifestyle Choices**
Lifestyle choices and cultural practices significantly influence melanoma risk. Behaviors such as indoor tanning and failure to use sun protection are major contributors (PMID:27638445; PMID:23300369; PMID:35076986). Historical shifts in clothing styles, social norms regarding tanned skin, and travel patterns have paralleled the rise in melanoma incidence (PMID:25211764). Among minority groups, such as Hispanics, lower awareness of melanoma risks and symptoms, coupled with a decline in sun-safe behaviors with acculturation, contribute to higher mortality rates despite lower incidence (PMID:30909356; PMID:32380221). Public education campaigns targeting communities of color are needed to promote self-examination, especially in non-sun-exposed areas where melanomas often appear in these populations (PMID:19691228; PMID:24485530).

**4.2. Diet and Nutrition**
Diet and nutrition may play a role in melanoma risk, although evidence from human trials is limited (PMID:34836731). Several case-control studies suggest associations between dietary patterns and melanoma. High diet quality, as measured by indexes like the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), has been linked to a lower risk of melanoma in women (PMID:26108541). Specific food consumption has also been correlated with risk; one study found a positive association with cereals, sweets, chocolate, and cabbages, and an inverse association with legumes, olive oil, eggs, and onions/garlic (PMID:31547443). Additionally, a high dietary glycemic load was associated with increased melanoma risk in females (PMID:28196548). Higher intake of caffeine from coffee has been associated with a lower risk of melanoma (PMID:26172864). Exposure to the heavy metal cadmium through diet has also been linked to an increased risk (PMID:31442947). In the context of treatment, a diet high in fiber was associated with improved survival in melanoma patients undergoing immune checkpoint blockade therapy (PMID:34941392).

**4.3. Immune System and Inflammation**
The immune system is implicated in melanoma development, primarily through the effects of UV radiation. UV exposure is known to cause inflammation and immunosuppression, both of which contribute to melanomagenesis (PMID:28703311; PMID:22123420). UV-induced immunosuppression in the skin is a major factor in the development of squamous cell carcinoma and is thought to play a role in melanoma as well (PMID:30205559). UVA radiation, in particular, may alter the immune microenvironment in ways that promote melanoma (PMID:29466611). While these mechanisms are established, the provided evidence does not detail inherent differences in the immune systems among human races that would directly explain the variance in melanoma incidence. The primary link is indirect: differences in skin pigmentation lead to different levels of UV-induced immunosuppression.

**4.4. Geographical and Historical Distribution**
Melanoma incidence shows significant variation based on geography. A California-based study found a higher incidence of in-situ melanoma in coastal counties compared to inland counties, even after adjusting for UV index and latitude, suggesting the influence of other environmental exposures or detection practices (PMID:24681542). Historically, melanoma rates increased significantly in white populations between 1973 and 1987, while they decreased for Black populations (PMID:8000999). In Sudan, the geographical distribution of malignant melanoma differed between the Northern and Southern regions, which are distinct ethnologically and geographically, pointing to the combined role of racial and environmental factors (PMID:4447778). Among non-Hispanic Black patients in the U.S., the lower limb is the most frequent site of melanoma in both northern and southern regions (PMID:22801611).","1. Fiscella K. et al. (2016).

","Racial differences in melanoma incidence are primarily determined by skin pigmentation and melanin content, which provide differential photoprotection against UV radiation-induced DNA damage. Non-Hispanic White individuals have the highest melanoma incidence rates (17.2-30 per 100,000), while Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander populations have substantially lower rates (0.7-3.0 per 100,000). [1-3] Beyond biological factors, differences in UV exposure patterns, genetic susceptibility (including MC1R variants and familial predisposition genes), diagnostic scrutiny, socioeconomic access to healthcare, and melanoma subtype distribution contribute to racial disparities in both incidence and outcomes. [1][4-5]

Skin Pigmentation as the Primary Determinant
The most fundamental factor determining racial differences in melanoma incidence is constitutive skin pigmentation. People of European origin typically have lower levels of melanin in the epidermis and higher proportions of pheomelanin (red-yellow pigment) rather than eumelanin (brown-black pigment), resulting in decreased photoprotection. [1] This biological difference translates to dramatically higher susceptibility to UV radiation-induced carcinogenic mutations and immune suppression. [1] Melanin provides substantial protection against UV-induced DNA damage. In Australia, where ambient UV radiation levels are among the highest globally, more than 95% of melanoma cases among the predominantly fair-skinned population have been attributed to UV exposure. [1] The protective effect of darker skin pigmentation is evidenced by the 10-20 fold lower incidence rates observed in Black, Asian, and Hispanic populations compared to non-Hispanic Whites. [2-3]
UV Radiation Exposure Patterns
Over 75% of cutaneous melanomas in White populations are estimated to be driven by the mutagenic effects of UV radiation. [5] High intermittent UV exposure during childhood has been established as a significant modifiable risk factor for melanoma in individuals with lighter skin phototypes, with evidence supporting associations between sunburns, recreational sun exposure, and melanoma development. [4-5] However, the role of UV radiation in melanoma development among individuals with skin of color remains poorly characterized. A systematic review examining UV exposure and melanoma risk in skin of color populations found limited and inconsistent data, with most studies conducted exclusively in fair-skinned populations. [6] This knowledge gap reflects both the lower incidence of melanoma in these populations and their historical underrepresentation in research. Geographic patterns support the UV-melanoma relationship in fair-skinned populations, with the highest incidence rates observed in Australia/New Zealand (60 per 100,000), followed by North America (30 per 100,000) and Europe (25 per 100,000), while melanoma remains rare in most parts of Africa, South and Central America, and Asia. [1] These geographic variations correlate with both ambient UV radiation levels and population ancestry.
Genetic Susceptibility Factors
Genetic factors beyond skin pigmentation contribute to racial differences in melanoma susceptibility. An estimated 10% of cutaneous melanomas occur in familial settings, with substantial advances identifying gene mutations associated with melanoma risk. [1] Mutations in highly penetrant genes such as CDKN2A/p16 and CDK4 account for 35-40% of familial melanomas, while common variants causing loss of function in the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (MC1R)—which plays a crucial role in skin and hair pigmentation—increase melanoma risk. [1] Individuals with Fitzpatrick skin type I (red hair with blue or green eyes) are at particularly elevated risk. [5] The protective phenotypes in darker-skinned populations include not only pigmented skin types but also associated factors such as fewer freckles, lower numbers of atypical nevi, and different sunbathing behaviors. [1] Interestingly, the reason melanoma rarely affects fair-skinned individuals of East Asian descent remains largely unknown, suggesting that genetic factors beyond simple pigmentation may modulate melanoma risk in complex ways across different ancestral populations. [1]
Melanoma Subtype Distribution Across Races
Racial groups exhibit markedly different distributions of melanoma histological subtypes, reflecting distinct etiologic pathways. Among non-Hispanic Whites, superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) is the most common subtype, typically occurring on intermittently sun-exposed skin of the trunk and limbs. [2][7] In contrast, acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) and mucosal melanoma—subtypes occurring on sun-protected sites—represent higher proportions of melanoma diagnoses in individuals with skin of color. [7-8] ALM accounts for only 0.8% of melanomas among non-Hispanic Whites but represents 19.1% among Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Asian/Pacific Islander individuals. [9] Among Black patients specifically, ALM is the most common histologic type. [2] Hispanic patients have the highest incidence rate of ALM among all racial groups (2.8 per 1,000,000), significantly higher than non-Hispanic Whites (2.3 per 1,000,000) and Asian/Pacific Islanders (1.7 per 1,000,000). [9] These subtype differences suggest variations in etiologic pathways. [2] While SSM and lentigo maligna melanoma are strongly associated with UV exposure, ALM and mucosal melanomas arise on non-sun-exposed sites and exhibit distinct molecular profiles dominated by structural chromosomal changes rather than UV signature mutations. This explains why melanoma can occur in darker-skinned populations despite their photoprotection.
Diagnostic Scrutiny and Healthcare Access
Beyond biological factors, diagnostic scrutiny significantly influences observed melanoma incidence rates. A county-level analysis in the United States found that melanoma incidence among non-Hispanic Whites was strongly associated not only with UV radiation exposure but also with proxies for diagnostic scrutiny, including personal income and physician supply. [10] This suggests that some portion of the observed incidence differences may reflect differential rates of skin examination and biopsy rather than true disease occurrence. Racial disparities in healthcare access contribute to both incidence patterns and outcomes. Decreased skin cancer education focused on people with skin of color, lower rates of screening, increased socioeconomic barriers, and underrepresentation in research and professional education contribute to delays in diagnosis and treatment. [4][8] These factors may paradoxically lower apparent incidence in some populations while simultaneously resulting in more advanced disease at diagnosis.
Stage at Diagnosis and Mortality Disparities
Despite lower incidence, individuals with skin of color are diagnosed with melanoma at significantly more advanced stages. Among men, melanoma was diagnosed after metastasis to a remote site in 15% of Hispanics, 13% of Asians, and 12% of Blacks, compared with only 6% of non-Hispanic Whites. Among women, 7% of Hispanics, 21% of Asians, and 19% of Blacks were diagnosed with late-stage melanoma compared with 4% of non-Hispanic Whites. [3] Non-White patients are more likely to have advanced and thicker melanomas at diagnosis and experience lower melanoma-specific survival compared with Whites. [2] African Americans present with deeper tumors, more advanced stage disease, and higher rates of ulceration and lymph node positivity than Caucasians, with cancer-specific mortality significantly higher for nodular and acral lentiginous melanoma subtypes. [11]
Racial disparities in melanoma-specific survival have worsened over time rather than improved. Analysis of the SEER database from 1975-2016 revealed that racial disparity worsened from before 2000 to 2010 or later for Hispanic (P < 0.001), non-Hispanic Black (P = 0.024), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (P < 0.001) patients. [12] Across all minority groups, patients with localized disease suffered increasing disparity, highlighting the need to improve postdiagnosis management for minorities. Remarkably, for acral lentiginous melanoma specifically, Black patients faced a significantly higher risk of mortality (HR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.31-3.11) compared to White patients even after controlling for disease severity at diagnosis and socioeconomic factors. [13] This finding counters previous assumptions that racial disparities in ALM are primarily attributed to delayed diagnosis, suggesting intrinsic biological","[1] Global Burden of Cutaneous Melanoma in 2020 and Projections to 2040.

Individuals with lighter skin (e.g. of European ancestry) have far higher melanoma rates than those with darker skin, because eumelanin pigment in deeply pigmented skin provides substantial protection against UV radiation–induced DNA damage, the key environmental cause of melanoma [1][2]. Epidemiological data demonstrate an inverse correlation between skin pigmentation and melanoma incidence – for example, in the United States, the age-adjusted melanoma incidence in Whites is on the order of twenty times greater than in African Americans [3]. Genetic predisposition linked to pigmentation also plays a role: fair-complexioned people often carry variants in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene (associated with red hair, freckling, and poor tanning) that result in less protective melanin and an elevated melanoma risk under UV exposure [4]. Moreover, the patterns of melanoma differ by race in ways that implicate UV exposure – lighter-skinned populations predominantly develop superficial spreading melanomas on sun-exposed skin, whereas darker-skinned populations more frequently develop acral lentiginous melanomas on the palms, soles, and nail beds (sites typically not sun-exposed) [5]. These subtype differences further suggest that melanin-rich skin is less prone to UV-driven melanoma, and that in individuals with skin of color, melanomas arise more often via UV-independent pathways. In summary, racial disparities in melanoma incidence are largely determined by the degree of constitutive skin melanin (and associated genetic factors) conferring variable protection against carcinogenic UV radiation, combined with differing predominant melanoma causes and subtypes across populations [1][2][5].

The striking racial gap in melanoma incidence is well documented. Fair-skinned Caucasian populations have the highest melanoma rates worldwide, whereas people of African or Asian descent experience far lower incidence [1][3]. Melanin concentration in the epidermis is a fundamental determinant of this difference. Darker skin contains more eumelanin, which absorbs and disperses UV radiation, thereby reducing UV-induced DNA damage in skin cells. Epidemiologic studies consistently show much lower skin cancer incidence in more pigmented populations and attribute this protection to epidermal melanin [1]. In fact, researchers observed a clear negative correlation between skin pigmentation and melanoma incidence, providing “strong support” for UV radiation as a major cause of melanoma and for melanin’s protective role in blocking UV effects [2]. Quantitatively, the disparity is enormous: one U.S. analysis (1992–2002) reported an average annual melanoma incidence of 18.4 per 100,000 in Whites versus only 0.8 per 100,000 in African Americans (with similarly low rates in Asians and other non-White groups) [3]. That equates to a 20-fold or greater difference in risk, underscoring how profoundly skin color influences melanoma susceptibility. This difference persists across geography – for example, in sunny South Africa, the melanoma rate in White residents is roughly an order of magnitude higher than in Black Africans, reflecting the same melanin-conferred UV protection effect noted elsewhere [2][3].

Importantly, genetic factors underlying skin pigmentation contribute to these incidence patterns. The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is a key regulator of human pigmentation; certain loss-of-function variants produce the “red hair/fair skin” phenotype (RHC phenotype) characterized by low eumelanin and high pheomelanin content [4]. People carrying MC1R RHC variants have poor tanning ability, freckling, and light skin, which dramatically heightens UV sensitivity. These pigmentary traits are well-established independent risk factors for melanoma [4]. Sturm (2002) notes that MC1R variants associated with red hair/fair skin are linked to increased melanoma risk, even when controlling for sun exposure, and are overrepresented in melanoma patients compared to the general population. Such variants are far more common in individuals of Northern European ancestry and rare in those of African or East Asian ancestry, meaning the genetic predisposition to melanoma (through pathways like MC1R) aligns with racial differences in skin type. In essence, populations with inherently fair skin not only lack the protective melanin barrier but often also carry genetic profiles (e.g. multiple MC1R polymorphisms) that further amplify UV damage and carcinogenesis, whereas deeply pigmented populations are genetically primed for high melanin production that shields skin DNA from UV-induced mutations [4].

UV radiation exposure is the major environmental driver of cutaneous melanoma, and the interplay of skin color and UV explains much of the racial incidence gap. Light-skinned groups incur more UV damage from comparable sun exposure due to lower melanin protection, resulting in higher mutation burdens in melanocytes over time
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. By contrast, dark-skinned individuals can tolerate higher levels of UV with less DNA damage – for example, one study found UV-induced DNA photoproducts in pale skin were about three times more abundant than in black skin for the same UV dose [1]. This difference in photoprotection is sufficient to yield a dramatically lower skin cancer incidence in heavily pigmented skin, as observed clinically [1]. It’s noteworthy that melanin’s protection, while significant, is not absolute; very high UV exposure can still overcome these defenses (and conversely, melanoma can still occur in dark-skinned people, just at much lower frequencies). Nevertheless, the endogenous “sun protection factor” of dark skin has been estimated around 10–15 SPF in African-descended populations, meaning a person with dark brown skin might tolerate 10-15 times more UVB radiation than a very light-skinned person before incurring equivalent damage. This natural UV shield largely explains why, in epidemiological terms, melanoma is predominantly a cancer of lighter-skinned populations who live in high-UV environments (e.g. European-ancestry people in Australia, North America, Europe) [2][3]. In those groups, intense intermittent UV exposure (sunburns, outdoor recreation, tanning bed use) is strongly linked to melanoma development, especially in childhood or adolescence when melanocyte DNA is particularly vulnerable [5]. For darker-skinned groups, the evidence linking UV to melanoma risk is less pronounced, and consistent with this, their melanoma incidence remains low even in sunny climates [5].

Additionally, differences in melanoma subtype and typical tumor location across races highlight distinct causal pathways. Among fair-skinned individuals, the majority of melanomas are the UV-associated subtypes (such as superficial spreading melanoma and nodular melanoma), often arising on sun-exposed areas of the body (the back, shoulders, limbs) after a history of intermittent sunburns or chronic UV exposure [5]. In contrast, in people with darker skin (African, Asian, or Hispanic backgrounds), melanomas are less commonly linked to cumulative sun damage and more often present as acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) or mucosal melanoma [5]. ALM occurs on the palms, soles, and under nails – sites typically not exposed to much UV, suggesting that factors other than UV play a dominant role in those tumors. Indeed, epidemiologic studies find that in Black and Asian patients, over half of melanomas occur on the foot or other acral locations, whereas such sites account for a tiny fraction of melanomas in Whites. For example, a U.S. study reported acral lentiginous melanoma as the most common histologic subtype in Black patients, whereas superficial spreading melanoma was most common in White, Hispanic, and other groups [5]. Similarly, an earlier global analysis noted virtually all of the (comparatively infrequent) melanomas in populations of African or Asian descent were acral or mucosal, with very low incidence on sun-exposed skin, reinforcing that UV-independent mechanisms (perhaps genetic mutations unrelated to UV, or chronic irritation, etc.) are relatively more important in melanoma pathogenesis in those populations [2]. The predominance of ALM in skin-of-color, and its relative rarity in Caucasians, led researchers to conclude that “the risk factors for melanoma development may differ between the White and Black populations,” and that melanoma in heavily pigmented skin is often a different disease entity with distinct etiologies.

Finally, it’s worth noting that while socioeconomic and healthcare factors do not biologically “determine” melanoma incidence, they can influence reported incidence to a degree. Lighter-skinned populations not only develop melanoma more often, but also historically have had greater awareness and screening for skin cancer. In darker-skinned communities, lower awareness and less frequent skin examinations have been documented, which can lead to melanomas being diagnosed at later stages [5]. However, these detection differences affect outcomes and survival more than the true underlying incidence. The fundamental driver of incidence disparity remains the biophysical protection conferred by melanin. In summary, racial differences in melanoma incidence are dictated by a combination of intrinsic protection (skin pigmentation genetics) and extrinsic exposure (UV light). Populations with low melanin (fair skin) experience more UV-induced melanocytic mutations and thus higher melanoma rates, whereas those with high melanin (dark skin) are shielded from many of the UV effects and consequently develop melanoma much more rarely [1][2][3]. Where melanomas do arise in heavily pigmented individuals, they tend to do so via pathways less reliant on UV, as evidenced by the prevalence of acral and mucosal melanomas in these groups [5]. These insights underscore melanin’s pivotal role in melanoma prevention and explain why melanoma is disproportionately a cancer of lighter-skinned peoples.","Fajuyigbe, D., & Young, A. R. (2016).

The most significant determinant of the difference in melanoma incidence among human races is the protective effect of melanin pigment against the damaging effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun [1]. 
Skin Pigmentation: Individuals with lighter skin tones (e.g., non-Hispanic white individuals) produce less melanin and are more susceptible to UV-induced DNA damage, leading to a much higher incidence of melanoma compared to individuals with darker skin (e.g., Black or African American individuals) [1]. The higher melanin concentration in darker skin acts as a natural broad-spectrum filter, providing substantial photoprotection [1].
Genetic Factors: Genetic variations play a critical role, particularly in genes that control the amount and type of melanin produced. Mutations in the MC1R gene, which are common in fair-skinned populations, are associated with red hair, fair skin, and increased melanoma risk [1].
UV Exposure and Behavior: Behavioral differences in sun exposure and sun-protective measures contribute to incidence rates. Individuals with lighter skin who live in high UV index areas and engage in significant recreational sun exposure have an elevated risk [1].
Healthcare and Awareness Disparities: While biological factors drive incidence, disparities in awareness, screening, and timely diagnosis contribute to differences in disease stage at presentation and outcomes. For instance, melanoma in Black and Hispanic populations is often diagnosed at a more advanced stage, potentially due to lower awareness of risk and less frequent skin cancer screening, leading to worse prognoses despite lower incidence rates [1].

59,Melanoma,"How does intratumoral heterogeneity impact responses of melanoma to therapy, and what is its mechanism?",Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER: Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) in melanoma significantly impairs therapy responses by fostering resistance and creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment. It is characterized by the coexistence of genetically and phenotypically distinct cancer cell populations within a single tumor, arising from ongoing genomic instability, clonal evolution, and cellular plasticity. This diversity allows for Darwinian selection of pre-existing or evolving therapy-resistant subclones, leading to treatment failure and relapse (PMID:24119551, PMID:29033130). High levels of ITH are mechanistically linked to immune evasion; they correlate with reduced infiltration of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells and increased tumor-promoting M2 macrophages, creating an immune-excluded microenvironment (PMID:33344244). Furthermore, the heterogeneous expression of therapeutic targets, such as cancer-testis antigens, on different subpopulations of cancer cells means that targeted immunotherapies may fail to eliminate the entire tumor mass (PMID:38886115). This complexity, which exists at the genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic levels, complicates diagnosis and makes therapy outcomes unpredictable, as single biopsies often fail to capture the full spectrum of a tumor's biological landscape (PMID:29078205, PMID:34951955).

ANALYSIS:
**An Investigative Report on the Impact and Mechanisms of Intratumoral Heterogeneity in Melanoma Therapy Response**

**1. Introduction: Defining Intratumoral Heterogeneity in Melanoma**

Genetic heterogeneity is a broad concept where different genetic factors can result in the same disease, classified into types such as allelic, locus, and phenotypic heterogeneity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_heterogeneity). In the context of cancer, particularly melanoma, this concept is refined into intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), which refers to the existence of distinct subpopulations of cancer cells within a single tumor. Melanoma is recognized as one of the most aggressive and heterogeneous human cancers, and there is growing evidence that this heterogeneity plays a critical role in its development, evolution, and resistance to therapy (PMID:35740696). This complexity arises from a high number of clones harboring various mutations, as well as metastases originating from different subclones of a primary lesion (PMID:29078205). The presence of ITH poses a significant challenge to effective treatment and accurate diagnosis, driving research into its underlying mechanisms and clinical consequences (PMID:29078205).

**2. The Biological Basis and Manifestations of Intratumoral Heterogeneity**

The heterogeneity observed within melanoma tumors is not a random occurrence but is rooted in specific biological processes that generate diversity at multiple molecular levels. This diversity manifests as distinct genetic, molecular, and phenotypic characteristics among cancer cells in the same tumor.

**2.1. Genomic Instability and Clonal Evolution**
Cutaneous malignant melanoma is characterized by a high mutational load and extensive genetic heterogeneity (PMID:30154148). This genomic instability fuels the development of multiple clones and subclones within a tumor, each with a unique set of mutations (PMID:29078205). The progression of melanoma involves distinct evolutionary patterns. For instance, in acral melanoma, the regional expansion of an invasive tumor can exhibit either clonal expansion, where a single dominant clone proliferates, or subclonal diversification, where new subclones continuously emerge. This process of subclonal diversification is notably associated with a more aggressive subset of invasive acral melanoma (PMID:38759655). This heterogeneity is not limited to the genome; it is a multi-layered phenomenon that includes the transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome, all of which contribute to the biological complexity of the disease (PMID:29078205).

**2.2. Spatial and Molecular Heterogeneity**
Advanced imaging and sequencing technologies have revealed that ITH has a distinct spatial architecture. The use of spatial transcriptomics on melanoma lymph node biopsies has uncovered a complex spatial composition that is not apparent through standard morphology. This analysis demonstrated that multiple distinct gene expression profiles and melanoma signatures can coexist within a single tumor region (PMID:30154148). This molecular zoning is also evident in the expression of key tumor suppressor proteins. A study of melanoma samples with focal loss of the PTEN protein found that PTEN-negative areas harbored specific genomic variations or deletions that were not detected in adjacent PTEN-positive areas of the same tumor. This finding highlights the existence of discrete, molecularly defined subclones within a single lesion (PMID:36871660).

**2.3. Phenotypic Variability and Cellular Plasticity**
The underlying genetic and transcriptional diversity within a tumor drives significant phenotypic variation, resulting in diverse cell populations with different behaviors (PMID:34105295, PMID:38702718).
*   **Transcriptional States:** A study using single-cell RNA sequencing of uveal melanoma uncovered ITH at both the genomic and transcriptomic levels, identifying distinct transcriptional cell states. One such state, characterized by the heterogeneous expression of the transcription factor HES6, was linked to an invasive phenotype and poor prognosis (PMID:33462406).
*   **Antigen Expression:** Phenotypic heterogeneity directly impacts immunotherapy. Single-cell analysis of cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) in melanoma revealed a high degree of transcriptional heterogeneity. Most individual CTAs, including common therapeutic targets like NY-ESO-1, were found to be expressed only in subpopulations of cancer cells. This creates a ""mosaic"" of cells with diverse antigen profiles, posing a substantial challenge to immunotherapies that target a single antigen, as they may fail to eliminate the entire tumor (PMID:38886115).
*   **Cancer Stemness:** The concept of cancer stemness is closely linked to ITH. A stem-like phenotype in cancer cells is positively correlated with ITH, suggesting that a subpopulation of cancer stem cells may be responsible for generating the diverse cell types within a tumor (PMID:35488273). Correspondingly, studies have shown that established melanoma cell lines exhibit heterogeneous features of cancer stem cells, such as the expression of the marker CD133 and the ability to form spheroids, with the CD133-positive population showing greater tumorigenic potential (PMID:23915418).

**3. Impact of Intratumoral Heterogeneity on Melanoma Therapy Response**

ITH is a primary driver of therapeutic failure in melanoma. It creates a resilient and adaptive tumor ecosystem that can withstand and evade treatment through several interconnected mechanisms.

**3.1. A Source of Therapy Resistance and Poor Prognosis**
ITH is recognized as a major obstacle to successful cancer treatment (PMID:24119551) and is a key factor limiting or causing the failure of contemporary therapies for melanoma (PMID:29078205). Studies have shown that increased clonal diversity and high mutational heterogeneity within a tumor are associated with a poor prognosis and more aggressive disease progression (PMID:24119551, PMID:27216186).

**3.2. Mechanisms of Resistance**
*   **Selection of Resistant Subclones:** A key mechanism of resistance involves the Darwinian selection of pre-existing, therapy-insensitive cell populations. A treatment may successfully eliminate the dominant, sensitive clones that make up the bulk of the tumor, but minor subclones that are inherently resistant can survive, proliferate, and lead to disease relapse (PMID:24119551).
*   **Dynamic Evolution Under Treatment:** Therapies can actively shape the tumor's genetic landscape. In a study of patients treated with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, responding tumors showed not only a reduction in mutation load but also evidence of differential clonal evolution. This suggests an active process of selection against neoantigenic mutations, whereby the therapy eliminates recognizable clones, allowing immune-evasive clones to thrive (PMID:29033130).
*   **Unpredictable Therapeutic Outcomes:** ITH makes it difficult to predict how a tumor will respond to treatment. Multivariable models combining metrics like tumor mutation burden (TMB) and IFNγ gene expression can predict response to immunotherapy with reasonable accuracy. However, some patients do not respond as predicted, and this outlier status is often attributed to the underlying inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity that is not captured by bulk analysis (PMID:34951955). This challenge is compounded by the fact that a single tumor biopsy may not be representative of the entire tumor's genomic landscape, leading to an underestimation of its complexity and potential for resistance (PMID:22397650).

**3.3. Modulation of the Tumor Immune Microenvironment**
ITH profoundly influences the composition and function of the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly the anti-tumor immune response, which is crucial for the success of immunotherapies.
*   **Creation of an Immunosuppressive TME:** A study utilizing a Clonal Heterogeneity Analysis Tool (CHAT) found that highly heterogeneous melanoma tumors were associated with a significant shift in the immune cell infiltrate. These tumors had less infiltration by anti-tumor immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, T follicular cells, and M1 macrophages, and an increase in tumor-promoting M2 macrophages. Furthermore, high ITH correlated with reduced expression of immunomodulatory genes like PD-1 and PD-L1 and a lower immune-mediated cytotoxicity score, indicating a direct link between heterogeneity and an immune-evasive, ""cold"" TME (PMID:33344244).
*   **Heterogeneity of Immune Infiltrates:** The immune cells within the TME are themselves heterogeneous. One study of melanoma patients identified a large population of CD8+ T cells that were progressing into a dysfunctional state. These dysfunctional T cells, paradoxically, were found to be the major proliferating immune cell compartment within the tumor, highlighting a complex and dynamic immune landscape (PMID:30595452). Another feature of the immune TME, the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), is associated with improved survival. However, these TLSs vary widely in their maturation state and cellular composition, suggesting that the nature of this immune heterogeneity is also prognostically significant (PMID:34103353).

**4. Conclusion and Future Insights**

Intratumoral heterogeneity is a fundamental and defining characteristic of melanoma that is central to its progression and therapeutic resistance. It arises from a dynamic interplay of genomic instability and cellular plasticity, resulting in a complex ecosystem of cancer cell subclones with diverse genetic, molecular, and phenotypic properties. This diversity directly impacts therapy by providing a reservoir for the selection of resistant clones, leading to treatment failure.

A key mechanism through which ITH impairs therapy, particularly immunotherapy, is by sculpting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. High heterogeneity is not merely a marker of complexity but an active driver of immune exclusion, characterized by a decrease in effective anti-tumor immune cells and an increase in suppressive cell types. The insight that ITH extends to the immune infiltrate itself—with dysfunctional T cells and variably mature TLSs—adds another layer of complexity that must be addressed.

The mosaic-like expression of therapeutic targets, such as cancer-testis antigens, underscores a critical challenge for targeted therapies: a successful response requires targeting not just one subclone, but all of them. This suggests that future therapeutic strategies for melanoma must evolve beyond single-target approaches. Novelty in treatment may come from multi-target therapies, customized based on single-cell profiling of a patient's tumor. An even more forward-looking approach would be to target the very processes that generate heterogeneity, such as pathways governing cellular plasticity or epigenetic regulation. By aiming to reduce the tumor's adaptive potential, it may be possible to overcome the formidable challenge posed by melanoma's intrinsic diversity and improve patient outcomes.","1. Newell F. et al.

Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) significantly impairs melanoma therapy responses by enabling pre-existing resistant subclones to survive treatment and by facilitating the emergence of new resistant phenotypes through phenotypic plasticity.[1-3] This heterogeneity operates through both genetic mechanisms (clonal diversity with distinct mutations) and non-genetic mechanisms (reversible phenotypic states), creating a ""moving target"" that adapts dynamically to therapeutic pressure.[2][4]
Mechanisms of ITH-Mediated Therapy Resistance
Genetic Heterogeneity and Clonal Selection
Melanomas harbor multiple genetically distinct subclones with differential treatment sensitivities.[5] During targeted therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors, pre-existing resistant clones carrying mutations in BRAF, NRAS, MEK1/2, or PI3K pathway genes are selectively enriched, leading to treatment failure.[6] The number of clones and their clonal diversity both independently contribute to resistance, with higher clonal heterogeneity associated with diminished immune responses and worse survival.[7-8]
Intertumoral heterogeneity between primary and metastatic lesions further complicates treatment, as different tumor sites may harbor distinct mutational profiles. Studies demonstrate mutational discordance in BRAF, NRAS, and TERT between paired primary and metastatic tumors in approximately 18% of patients.[9]
Phenotypic Plasticity and Non-Genetic Resistance
Melanoma cells exhibit remarkable phenotypic plasticity, transitioning between proliferative and invasive states in response to microenvironmental stressors including therapy.[1-2] This plasticity is regulated by microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) expression levels. Proliferative melanoma cells (MITF-high) can switch to slow-cycling, invasive states (MITF-low) characterized by upregulation of WNT5A, AXL, and NF-κB signaling.[1] These slow-cycling cells demonstrate increased intrinsic drug resistance and can give rise to new proliferative populations with acquired resistance through their stem cell-like properties.[1]
Single-cell analyses reveal that resistance mechanisms involve not only selection of pre-existing subclones but also reversible transitions between different transcriptional states.[10-11] This dynamic heterogeneity allows melanoma cells to functionally overcome MAPK inhibition without acquiring new mutations.[2]
Impact on Immunotherapy
ITH profoundly affects immunotherapy responses through multiple mechanisms. High ITH correlates with reduced infiltration of anti-tumor CD8+ T cells, T follicular cells, and M1 macrophages, while promoting immunosuppressive M2 macrophages.[12] Tumors with high heterogeneity show decreased expression of immune checkpoint molecules including PD-1 and PD-L1, along with reduced cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity.[12]
The relationship between ITH and immunity is bidirectional—immune pressure drives clonal selection and increases heterogeneity, while heterogeneity in turn dampens anti-tumor immune responses.[8] Clonal neoantigens (present in all tumor cells) elicit more robust immune responses than subclonal neoantigens, explaining why clonal tumor mutational burden predicts immunotherapy response better than total mutational burden.[7-8]
Experimental models demonstrate that UVB-induced ITH diminishes immune responses even when total mutational burden remains high, and that single-cell-derived tumors with reduced ITH are more readily rejected by the immune system.[7]
Microenvironmental Influences
The tumor microenvironment actively shapes ITH through hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and immune interactions.[1][13] Spatial heterogeneity in the microenvironment creates distinct selective pressures across different tumor regions, promoting the coexistence of multiple phenotypic states.[13-14] Cancer-associated fibroblasts, immune cell populations, and metabolic gradients all contribute to maintaining heterogeneous tumor cell populations with varying therapy sensitivities.[14-15]
Clinical Implications
ITH presents major challenges for precision medicine approaches. Standard single-biopsy molecular profiling may miss clinically relevant subclones present in other tumor regions or metastatic sites.[5][16] Multiregion sequencing and liquid biopsy approaches are emerging as strategies to better capture the full spectrum of tumor heterogeneity.[16]
Therapeutic strategies to address ITH include combination approaches targeting both proliferative and invasive melanoma states, adaptive therapy protocols that modulate treatment intensity based on tumor burden, and sequencing strategies that account for the temporal evolution of resistant subpopulations.[1][17] However, standardized methods for measuring and clinically applying ITH metrics remain limited.[18-19]

 Leading Journal","Intratumoral heterogeneity in melanoma often underlies variable and incomplete therapeutic responses. Tumors composed of diverse subclonal populations tend to develop resistance: treatments may eliminate sensitive melanoma cell subpopulations, but other inherently resistant or adaptable clones survive, leading to tumor relapse or progression [1][2]. This clonal diversity is a major reason melanoma can quickly evade targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Mechanistically, intratumoral heterogeneity enables a “Darwinian” selection process under therapy: pre-existing minor subclones with alternative oncogenic mutations or survival pathways can outgrow once dominant sensitive cells are wiped out [1][3]. For example, not all melanoma cells in a tumor share the same driver mutations—some lesions contain mixtures of BRAF-mutant and BRAF-wildtype (or NRAS-mutant) cells, so a BRAF inhibitor will only kill the mutant subset while allowing other clones to persist and drive recurrence [3]. Moreover, melanoma cells can exhibit phenotype plasticity (switching between proliferative, drug-sensitive states and invasive, drug-tolerant states), further contributing to therapeutic resistance [2]. Heterogeneity also dampens immune therapy efficacy: highly heterogeneous melanomas show reduced T-cell infiltration and respond worse to immune checkpoint inhibitors, as certain clonal variants escape immune recognition [4][5]. In summary, intratumoral heterogeneity promotes melanoma treatment failure by supplying a reservoir of diverse, therapy-evasive cancer cell variants and mechanisms that collectively enable the tumor to adapt and survive despite initial therapy.

Impact on Melanoma Therapy Response: Intratumoral heterogeneity is recognized as a key obstacle to effective melanoma treatment. Because melanoma tumors consist of genetically and phenotypically diverse cell subpopulations, therapeutic responses are often uneven – some parts of the tumor respond while others do not, leading to partial responses or early relapse [1][2]. Studies have documented that melanoma’s high intratumor clonal diversity correlates with poor treatment outcomes. For instance, Somasundaram et al. note that melanoma’s inherent heterogeneity makes it “an aggressive, drug-resistant cancer,” prone to developing rapid therapy resistance [1]. A recent comprehensive review likewise emphasizes that tumor heterogeneity plays an “imperative role” in melanoma evolution and resistance to therapy【2】. Clinically, this means that even highly targeted treatments (like kinase inhibitors or immune checkpoint blockers) often cannot eradicate all tumor cells if distinct resistant clones are present from the start. Evidence in patients supports this: Heinzerling et al. found that different melanoma cell clones within the same patient (and even within individual tumors) can harbor different driver mutations, such as BRAF vs. NRAS mutations, implying that a single targeted drug will leave some clones unaffected [3]. Indeed, intratumoral genetic heterogeneity has been cited as a major cause of treatment failure in solid cancers, including melanoma [3]. As a result, melanomas frequently show mixed responses to therapy – portions of the tumor may shrink, but foci containing resistant subclones continue growing, eventually causing disease progression [1][3].

Mechanisms Driving Heterogeneity-Driven Resistance: Several biological mechanisms explain how intratumoral heterogeneity confers therapy resistance in melanoma. (1) Clonal Evolution and Selection: Tumor heterogeneity provides fertile ground for Darwinian selection under therapy pressure. When treatment is applied, any melanoma subclone that by chance carries a mutation or pathway activation conferring drug resistance will survive and become dominant. Over time, these resistant clones repopulate the tumor. As one example, a minor subpopulation of BRAF-wildtype cells in a largely BRAF-mutant melanoma can expand during BRAF inhibitor therapy, because the wildtype cells are not affected by the drug [3]. This clonal selection mechanism is a well-documented route through which melanomas escape targeted inhibitors [1][3]. Similarly, melanoma cases have been reported where co-existing subclones with alternate oncogenic mutations (e.g. NRAS or MEK pathway alterations) emerge during therapy, driving relapse despite initial response to a targeted agent [3]. (2) Phenotypic Plasticity: Melanoma cells are notorious for switching phenotypic states, which contributes to intratumoral diversity and drug tolerance. Tumor cells can reversibly transition between a highly proliferative, differentiation-like state and a more invasive, stem-like state. The invasive or “mesenchymal-like” state (often characterized by low MITF and high AXL expression) is associated with intrinsic resistance to both targeted therapies and immune attack. Heterogeneity in these cell states within a tumor means some cells are inherently less sensitive to drugs. Ng et al. note that such phenotypic heterogeneity enables subsets of melanoma cells to survive therapy by entering a drug-tolerant state, later giving rise to recurrence [2]. In practice, treatments may kill the bulk of tumor cells in the drug-sensitive state while sparing a small fraction of cells that had switched to a protective state, again leading to regrowth. (3) Immune Evasion Through Heterogeneity: Intratumoral heterogeneity can also reduce the effectiveness of immunotherapy. A diverse tumor cell population will express a wider range of antigens and immune modulatory molecules. Some subclones may lack the key neoantigens that T cells target or may induce an immunosuppressive microenvironment, allowing those clones to escape immune surveillance. Research has shown that melanomas with high intratumor heterogeneity tend to have lower T-cell infiltration and activity – in one study, patients whose tumors had more heterogenous mutation profiles had significantly reduced immune gene signatures and worse survival outcomes [4]. This suggests that immune checkpoint inhibitors (which rely on T cells recognizing tumor antigens) are less likely to fully eradicate a highly heterogeneous melanoma, since certain clones can “fly under the radar” of the immune system. Wolf and Samuels (2022) describe a bidirectional interplay between tumor heterogeneity and immunity: over time, immune pressure eliminates the most immunogenic cancer cell clones, but in doing so, selects for variant cells that are less visible to the immune system, thereby sculpting a more resistant, immune-evasive tumor [5]. In summary, intratumoral heterogeneity arms melanoma with multiple distinct survival strategies – genetic mutations in different clones, adaptive phenotype changes, and varied antigen profiles – all of which together undermine the uniform efficacy of therapy. Combating this challenge is a major focus of current melanoma research, as more homogeneous or combinatorial treatment strategies are needed to address the full spectrum of tumor cell variants present in an individual melanoma [2][5].","Somasundaram, R., Villanueva, J., & Herlyn, M.

The primary mechanism involves the selection and subsequent expansion of these treatment-resistant subclones under therapeutic pressure, driven by both genetic and non-genetic factors like cellular plasticity and the tumor microenvironment. 

Melanoma is characterized by notable phenotypic plasticity and significant ITH, which poses a major challenge to effective treatment with both targeted therapies and immunotherapies. 
The impact and mechanisms of ITH on therapy response include:
Selective survival of resistant subpopulations: Single-agent therapies, such as those targeting BRAF mutations, often eliminate sensitive tumor cells while leaving other pre-existing, unharmed subpopulations to survive, repopulate the tumor, and continue progressing.
Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms: Resistance is fueled by both genetic and non-genetic mechanisms.
Genetic alterations include secondary mutations, such as a secondary BRAF L505H mutation observed in a vemurafenib-resistant patient, that directly interfere with drug efficacy.
Epigenetic changes also play a crucial role. For example, promoter methylation is responsible for the heterogeneous expression of cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) within a tumor, which can limit the effectiveness of CTA-based vaccine therapy.
LncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) can influence this plasticity, with specific lncRNAs like GRASLND being associated with differentiation states and influencing immune signaling pathways like IFNγ.
Phenotypic plasticity and cell state transitions: Melanoma cells can undergo reversible cell-state transitions between different phenotypes (e.g., proliferative, neural crest-like, invasive). This plasticity allows cells to evade therapy; the transition to a dedifferentiated, slow-proliferating but highly invasive state is a key mechanism of drug tolerance and increased metastasis.
Tumor microenvironment (TME) modulation and immune evasion: ITH within the TME contributes to immune evasion and limits the success of immunotherapies.
Heterogeneity in the expression of immune checkpoints, such as PD-L1, can be aggravated by dynamics with IFNγ signaling, leading to varied immune suppression across different tumor regions.
Mechanisms of resistance to PD-1 inhibitors include transcriptional downregulation of MHC class I and the acquisition of a MITFlow/AXLhigh de-differentiated phenotype, a process driven by factors like TGFß signaling.
Lesion-specific responses: In patients with multiple metastases, significant intertumoral heterogeneity can lead to mixed, lesion-specific responses where some metastases respond to treatment while others progress simultaneously. This highlights that a single biopsy may not capture the immune status or molecular profile of all tumors in a patient. ","Hoogstraat, M., Gadellaa-van Hooijdonk, C. G., Ubink, I., Besselink, N. J.

60,Melanoma,How does melanoma cell adapt to environmental stress by altering metabolic programs? Can those programs be targeted for melanoma treatment?,Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER: Melanoma cells adapt to environmental stresses such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and oxidative stress by activating intricate survival pathways and extensively reprogramming their metabolism. Key stress response mechanisms include the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which modulate gene expression to restore homeostasis or trigger cell death if damage is irreparable. Melanoma cells alter their metabolism by increasing reliance on specific pathways depending on the stressor. For instance, they enhance fatty acid metabolism for survival in lymphatics and protection from ferroptosis, upregulate wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (wtIDH1) to maintain redox balance under nutrient limitation, and exhibit metabolic plasticity, shifting between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic reprogramming is often driven by oncogenic mutations, such as in the BRAF/MAPK pathway, and supports cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to therapy.

These adaptive metabolic programs create specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted for melanoma treatment. Therapeutic strategies include small molecule inhibitors targeting the BRAF/MAPK pathway (e.g., vemurafenib) and MEK, which are highly effective in patients with BRAF mutations. Additionally, inhibiting wtIDH1 has shown preclinical efficacy, particularly when combined with conventional chemotherapy, by increasing oxidative stress. Other promising strategies involve targeting nucleotide depletion, a vulnerability conserved from melanoma's neural crest origin, and dual inhibition of DUSP4 and DUSP6, which selectively kills BRAF/NRAS mutant cells. Furthermore, metabolic profiling of patient tumors and immune cells is emerging as a powerful tool to predict responses to immunotherapy, with signatures in lipid metabolism and glycolysis correlating with better outcomes. Combining metabolic inhibitors with targeted therapies or immunotherapies represents a promising approach to overcome resistance and improve patient survival.

ANALYSIS:
### **1. Introduction: Understanding Melanoma and Environmental Stress**

Melanoma is a form of cancer that originates from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin pigment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma). While typically a skin cancer, it can rarely develop in other locations like the mouth, intestines, or eyes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma). Melanoma cells exhibit significant adaptability, allowing them to survive in harsh environmental conditions and contributing to their genomic instability and resistance to treatment (PMID:26450371).

Epidermal melanocytes, the precursors to melanoma, are constantly subjected to environmental stressors, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation and various chemotoxins (PMID:33215847). Within the tumor microenvironment, melanoma cells face additional challenges such as hypoxia (low oxygen), nutrient deprivation, and suboptimal pH levels (PMID:33215847). A key component of this stressful environment is the redox imbalance characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). Cancer cells, including melanoma, have developed mechanisms to precisely control the intracellular levels of these reactive species to avoid cell death while promoting processes like the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that are crucial for metastasis (PMID:31009708).

### **2. Cellular Mechanisms for Sensing and Responding to Stress**

Melanoma cells employ several evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways to detect and respond to environmental stress, enabling their survival and adaptation.

#### **2.1 The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and Integrated Stress Response (ISR)**
In response to stressors like UV radiation and conditions within the tumor microenvironment (hypoxia, nutrient deprivation), melanocytes and melanoma cells activate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). These pathways aim to restore cellular homeostasis by modulating transcription and translation and by activating antioxidant defenses through the NRF2 transcription factor. However, if the damage is too severe to be repaired, these same pathways can trigger cell death. Paradoxically, the UPR/ISR can also facilitate adaptation, allowing damaged, mutated cells to survive, which can promote melanomagenesis, tumor growth, metastasis, and the development of resistance to both chemotherapy and immunotherapy (PMID:33215847).

#### **2.2 The Heat-Shock Response (HSR)**
The heat-shock response, orchestrated by Heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), is another crucial adaptive pathway co-opted by cancer cells to support malignancy. The ubiquitin ligase FBXW7α normally regulates HSF1 by targeting it for degradation. In melanoma, FBXW7α is often mutated or downregulated, leading to the accumulation of nuclear HSF1. This stabilization of HSF1 activates a transcriptional program that supports invasion and metastasis, correlating with disease progression and increased metastatic potential in patients (PMID:25720964).

#### **2.3 The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) Pathway**
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor activated by a wide range of environmental stressors, including UV radiation and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in pollution and tobacco smoke (PMID:31795255). Chronic activation of AHR signaling in the skin is linked to premature aging and the development of skin cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. In melanoma, AHR's role is complex; some studies suggest it promotes invasion by inducing matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), while others indicate it can reduce migratory capacity. AHR activation has also been implicated in conferring resistance to targeted therapies like BRAF inhibitors and in modulating the response to immunotherapies by affecting the production of immunosuppressive metabolites like kynurenine and regulating the expression of immune checkpoints like PD-1 (PMID:31795255).

#### **2.4 UV-Induced Signaling Pathways**
Exposure to UVB radiation, a primary environmental stressor for melanocytes, stimulates specific signaling cascades. UVB increases the expression of transcription factors Nurr-1 and Nur77, which in turn upregulate Urocortin 1 (Ucn1). This secreted Ucn1 then acts in an autocrine fashion on melanoma cells to increase the production of tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1), an enzyme involved in modulating melanin production as a protective response to UVB stress (PMID:25240771).

### **3. Metabolic Reprogramming as a Core Adaptive Strategy**

To survive and proliferate under stressful conditions, melanoma cells fundamentally alter their metabolic programs. This metabolic plasticity is a hallmark of aggressive cancers and is driven by both intrinsic oncogenic signaling and extrinsic environmental pressures.

#### **3.1 Alterations in Key Metabolic Pathways and Molecules**
Melanoma cells adapt to various stresses by modulating specific metabolic pathways:
*   **ERBB3 Signaling:** The protein LZTR1, which is amplified in acral melanomas, provides a growth advantage under environmental stress by activating the ERBB3 receptor. This activation regulates the cytoskeleton and promotes cell migration and adhesion, acting as a ""safeguard"" for melanoma cells under stress (PMID:40885854).
*   **Fatty Acid Metabolism:** To survive transit through the lymphatic system and establish metastatic tumors, melanoma cells enhance their capacity to metabolize fatty acids. This metabolic shift appears to protect the cells from ferroptosis, a form of cell death driven by oxidative stress, thereby increasing their survival during metastasis (PMID:32814895). In the context of immunotherapy, higher lipid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation were observed in patients who responded to treatment. Increased lipid metabolism was found to enhance melanoma immunogenicity by boosting antigen presentation, making the cells more susceptible to T cell-mediated killing (PMID:31495571).
*   **Glycosphingolipid Synthesis:** Under hypoxic conditions, melanoma cells decrease the expression of the enzyme GM3 synthase via the action of HIF-1α. This reduction in the ganglioside GM3 increases the cells' resistance to oxidative stress and radiation therapy by upregulating the ERK signaling pathway (PMID:32861756).
*   **Adenosine Production:** Melanoma cells often express high levels of the enzyme CD73, which produces immunosuppressive adenosine in the extracellular space. CD73 expression is upregulated in response to nutritional stress and contributes to therapeutic resistance. Notably, treatment with BRAF inhibitors can reduce CD73 expression, suggesting its role in acquired resistance (PMID:38941889).
*   **Autophagy and Organelle Dysfunction:** In response to UV-induced ROS generation by certain nanoparticles, Golgi structures in melanoma cells can be transformed, promoting autophagy that ultimately leads to apoptosis. This highlights how metabolic stress responses can be manipulated to induce cancer cell death (PMID:31729218).

#### **3.2 The Role of Metabolic Enzymes and Pathways in Survival**
Specific enzymes play a critical role in metabolic reprogramming for survival:
*   **Wild-Type Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (wtIDH1):** Melanoma cells adapt to nutrient withdrawal by increasing the expression of wtIDH1. This enzyme is crucial for maintaining redox homeostasis by generating NADPH and for supporting mitochondrial function through the production of α-ketoglutarate. Its inhibition leads to increased ROS and impairs melanoma cell survival under nutrient-limited conditions, making it a key metabolic dependency (PMID:36153582).
*   **Acetyl-CoA Synthetase 1 (ACSS1):** Cancer cells can use acetate as an alternative nutrient source. ACSS1-dependent metabolism of acetate into acetyl-CoA alters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the redox state of cancer cells. Knockdown of ACSS1 was shown to inhibit melanoma tumor growth and metastasis, identifying it as another important enzyme in metabolic adaptation (PMID:39579354).

#### **3.3 Impact of Metabolic Reprogramming on Tumor Growth and Metastasis**
Metabolic reprogramming is not merely a survival mechanism but a core driver of malignancy. Altered metabolism has been elevated to the status of a core hallmark of cancer (PMID:22439925). This metabolic plasticity allows cancer cells to meet the distinct energetic and biosynthetic demands of rapid growth in the primary tumor and colonization of distant metastatic sites (PMID:27587539). Oncogenic mutations, such as the activating V599E mutation in the BRAF kinase, are central drivers of this reprogramming, mediating cellular responses to growth signals via the ERK MAP kinase pathway (PMID:12068308). Increased lipid synthesis and uptake are particularly prominent features, contributing to melanoma aggressiveness, invasion, and migration (PMID:33121001). This dynamic adaptation involves shifts between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, increased glutaminolysis, and the utilization of alternative substrates like lactate and acetate, all controlled by oncogenes and the tumor microenvironment (PMID:33946927).

### **4. Therapeutic Targeting of Melanoma's Metabolic Adaptations**

The metabolic adaptations that melanoma cells rely on for survival also create specific vulnerabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention.

#### **4.1 Strategies to Exploit Metabolic Vulnerabilities**
Researchers are exploring several strategies to disrupt melanoma's metabolic plasticity:
*   **Targeting Developmental Pathways:** Melanoma cells often revert to a state resembling their neural crest lineage. These precursor cells have a unique sensitivity to nucleotide depletion, a metabolic vulnerability that is conserved in melanoma and can be therapeutically exploited (PMID:34281491).
*   **Disrupting Glycolysis via MAPK Pathway:** The constitutive activation of the BRAF/MAPK pathway in many melanomas sustains a high rate of aerobic glycolysis. Therefore, targeting this pathway directly disrupts a core metabolic program essential for the cancer cells (PMID:31362075, PMID:32528879).
*   **Targeting Asparagine Metabolism:** Blocking the MAPK-c-MYC-SLC7A5 signaling axis can cooperate with asparagine restriction to suppress melanoma cell proliferation, demonstrating a strategy that combines pathway inhibition with nutrient limitation (PMID:33554439). The general principle is that melanomas are metabolically heterogeneous, and disrupting these various metabolic pathways represents a promising therapeutic approach (PMID:29049843).

#### **4.2 Efficacy of Specific Metabolic-Targeted Therapies**
Several targeted therapies have shown clinical or preclinical success:
*   **BRAF and MEK Inhibitors:** The discovery of activating BRAF mutations led to the development of highly effective small molecule inhibitors of BRAF and the downstream protein MEK. These drugs have revolutionized the treatment of BRAF-mutant melanoma, significantly improving patient survival (PMID:24080641, PMID:29164492). The efficacy of these inhibitors depends on the specific class of BRAF mutation (Class 1, 2, or 3), which dictates their mechanism of ERK pathway activation (PMID:28783719, PMID:29540830).
*   **wtIDH1 Inhibition:** The FDA-approved mutant IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120) also exhibits potent activity against wtIDH1, particularly under the low nutrient conditions of the tumor microenvironment. In preclinical models, inhibiting wtIDH1 showed synergistic anti-tumor activity when combined with conventional chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a novel treatment for advanced melanoma (PMID:36153582).
*   **Dual DUSP4/DUSP6 Inhibition:** A CRISPR screen identified that the dual inactivation of the phosphatases DUSP4 and DUSP6 selectively impairs the growth of NRAS and BRAF mutant melanoma cells by causing hyperactivation of MAPK signaling. This finding reveals a novel ""digenic vulnerability"" that could be leveraged for new therapeutic targets, especially in tumors resistant to standard MAPK inhibitors (PMID:34857952).

#### **4.3 Metabolic Profiling as a Predictive Biomarker**
Metabolic analysis is emerging as a valuable tool for predicting patient response to therapy:
*   **Immunotherapy Response:** Pre-treatment analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from melanoma patients revealed that responders to anti-PD-1 therapy had higher respiratory capacity and glycolytic activity compared to non-responders. Specific metabolic signatures, including upregulated glycolysis-related genes in T-cells, characterized checkpoint inhibitor responders, suggesting that blood bioenergetics could serve as predictive biomarkers (PMID:35284940). Similarly, clinical data indicates that higher levels of the succinyltransferase CPT1A and lower levels of PD-L1 in tumors correlate with better responses to anti-PD-1 therapy, linking lipid metabolism to treatment efficacy (PMID:40069506).

### **5. Challenges, Limitations, and Broader Clinical Impact**

While targeting metabolic programs holds immense promise, it also presents significant challenges. The complexity of metabolic pathways and the heterogeneity within and between tumors can limit the effectiveness of treatments (PMID:32814895, PMID:31495571). Rarer melanoma subtypes, such as uveal, mucosal, and acral melanoma, have distinct genetic and metabolic profiles, complicating the application of therapies developed for cutaneous melanoma (PMID:34127435). Furthermore, the influence of the tumor microenvironment, such as interactions with adipocytes in subcutaneous tissues, is still poorly understood (PMID:29903879).

Despite these challenges, the broader impact of targeting these pathways has been transformative. The development of BRAF/MEK inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 has dramatically improved overall survival for patients with late-stage melanoma (PMID:29164492). However, resistance remains a major issue, and combination therapies, while often more effective, can lead to significant toxicities (PMID:39636504). Emerging research also highlights the role of external factors, such as the gut microbiota, in modulating patient outcomes with immunotherapy, opening new avenues for intervention (PMID:38157864).

### **6. Conclusion: Novel Insights**

Melanoma's adaptation to environmental stress through metabolic reprogramming is a double-edged sword. While it endows cancer cells with remarkable resilience, survival, and metastatic potential, it simultaneously creates a landscape of targetable vulnerabilities. The success of BRAF/MEK inhibitors exemplifies how disrupting a central metabolic-oncogenic axis can yield profound clinical benefits. A key insight from the collective evidence is that a static view of cancer metabolism is insufficient; melanoma exhibits profound metabolic plasticity, dynamically shifting its dependencies in response to therapy and environmental cues. This underscores the need for therapeutic strategies that can either trap cells in a metabolically untenable state or exploit the new vulnerabilities that arise during adaptation. The future of melanoma therapy likely lies in personalized, combination approaches that integrate metabolic profiling to guide the use of targeted inhibitors, immunotherapies, and novel agents designed to dismantle the metabolic scaffolding that supports this aggressive disease.

Metabolic Adaptation Mechanisms
Melanoma exhibits remarkable metabolic plasticity driven by oncogenic mutations, particularly in BRAF, which constitutively activates the MAPK pathway.[2-3] Under baseline conditions, melanoma cells predominantly rely on glycolysis (the Warburg effect) to support rapid proliferation and macromolecular synthesis.[1-2] However, when faced with environmental stressors—including nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, or therapeutic pressure from BRAF/MEK inhibitors—melanoma cells demonstrate adaptive metabolic rewiring.[4][6]
The most clinically significant adaptation is the metabolic shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS in response to BRAF inhibition.[2][4][6] This metabolic flexibility enables melanoma cells to survive targeted therapy by upregulating mitochondrial TCA cycle activity and increasing dependence on glutamine utilization to support TCA cycle substrates.[4][7] Additionally, melanoma cells enhance lipid metabolism, including fatty acid oxidation and synthesis, to meet energetic and biosynthetic demands during stress conditions.[8]
Epigenetic modifications bidirectionally regulate metabolic reprogramming in melanoma.[9] Specific metabolites serve as cofactors or substrates for epigenetic enzymes, directly modulating the epigenome, while epigenetic alterations influence transcriptional control of metabolic genes.[9] This metabolism-epigenetics axis contributes to the high plasticity that enables rapid modulation of cell states in response to environmental and therapeutic pressures.[9]
Metabolic Crosstalk with the Tumor Microenvironment
Melanoma cells actively manipulate the tumor microenvironment through metabolic competition and production of immunosuppressive metabolites.[1][10] By consuming nutrients critical for immune cell function and secreting metabolic byproducts like lactate, melanoma cells impair anti-tumor immune responses and facilitate immune evasion.[1][5][10] This metabolic crosstalk between tumor cells and immune cells represents a key mechanism of resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors.[5]
The gut microbiome also influences melanoma metabolism and immunotherapy response through nutrient-derived metabolites.[11] Diets rich in fermentable fibers and plant polyphenols modulate tumor metabolism and enhance CD8+ T-cell activity, while high fiber intake correlates with favorable gut microbiota composition and improved immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy.[11]
Therapeutic Targeting Strategies
Multiple metabolic pathways have emerged as therapeutic targets in melanoma:
1. Targeting Glycolysis-OXPHOS Flexibility: The metabolic shift to OXPHOS during BRAF inhibitor treatment represents a vulnerability that can be exploited through combination therapies.[4][6] Inhibiting mitochondrial respiration or targeting glutamine metabolism can overcome resistance to BRAF inhibitors.[4][12] For example, 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) inhibits glycolysis and enhances vemurafenib efficacy, while dichloroacetate (a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor) can be combined with agents that reduce mitochondrial respiration.[12]
2. NAD/NAMPT Pathway Inhibition: Activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism, particularly through its rate-limiting enzyme NAMPT, drives targeted therapy resistance and melanoma progression.[13] Inhibiting NAMPT represents a promising strategy to overcome treatment resistance by disrupting melanoma's metabolic adaptation.[13]
3. mTOR Pathway Targeting: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates melanoma cell anabolic functions and energy metabolism at the interface between treatment sensitivity and resistance. mTOR inhibition can prevent metabolic adaptation that enables drug resistance.[13]
4. Lipid Metabolism Modulation: Reprogramming of lipid metabolism, including alterations in fatty acid synthesis and oxidation, contributes to drug resistance.[8] Targeting lipid metabolic pathways offers potential for overcoming therapeutic resistance in melanoma.[8]
5. Metabolic Enhancement of Immunotherapy: Modulating tumor metabolism can improve immune checkpoint inhibitor responses by reducing tumor growth while enhancing immune cell functionality.[5] However, this approach requires careful balancing, as metabolic pathways are commonly shared between immune and tumor cells.[5] Dietary interventions, including Mediterranean and ketogenic diets, fasting-mimicking diets, and methionine restriction, can reprogram tumor metabolism and enhance CD8+ T-cell fitness.[11]
Clinical Challenges and Future Directions
Despite promising preclinical data, metabolic targeting in melanoma faces challenges related to metabolic heterogeneity and context-dependent effects.[1] The dynamic nature of melanic metabolism means that therapeutic interventions must account for tumor heterogeneity, microenvironmental influences, and the potential for compensatory metabolic adaptations. [1][6]
Combination approaches targeting multiple metabolic pathways simultaneously or combining metabolic inhibitors with targeted therapy or immunotherapy show the most promise for clinical translation.[4-5][12] Precision nutrition strategies, potentially guided by AI-driven nutrient-protein interaction mapping, represent an emerging paradigm to support existing therapeutic approaches.[11]","1.

Cancer Medicine. 2024;13(21):e70386. doi:10.1002/cam4.70386.","Melanoma cells adapt to environmental stress through remarkable metabolic plasticity, reprogramming their energy pathways to survive under harsh conditions. This means that melanoma can flexibly switch between metabolic programs – for example, increasing glycolysis under hypoxia or ramping up oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) when nutrients like glucose are scarce – to meet its energy and biosynthetic needs in different microenvironments [1][2]. Such metabolic adaptability also underlies therapy resistance: treatment pressure (e.g. MAPK pathway inhibitors in BRAF-mutant melanoma) often triggers a shift from glycolysis toward mitochondrial OXPHOS, allowing melanoma cells to endure drug-induced stress [1]. Importantly, these reprogrammed metabolic pathways create vulnerabilities that can be targeted for melanoma treatment. Inhibitors of key metabolic nodes – glycolysis, glutamine metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, or mitochondrial respiration – have shown promise in impairing melanoma cell growth and resensitizing tumors to therapy, especially when combined to overcome the tumor’s metabolic flexibility [2][3].

Cutaneous melanoma is highly aggressive and displays metabolic plasticity – a dynamic flexibility in fuel usage and metabolic pathways – that enables it to cope with various environmental stresses [1][2]. Changes in the tumor microenvironment, such as oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) or limited nutrients, elicit metabolic reprogramming in melanoma cells to maintain survival and proliferation. For instance, melanoma can switch between aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation depending on conditions: under glucose starvation it increases OXPHOS capacity, whereas in hypoxic conditions it relies more on glycolysis and attenuates mitochondrial respiration [1]. This adaptability allows melanoma cells to continue generating ATP and essential biomolecules even in hostile environments. The close interplay between melanoma metabolism and the microenvironment not only supports tumor growth but also contributes to immune escape – hypoxia and oncogenic drivers push melanoma toward glycolytic metabolism (Warburg effect), leading to excess lactate and an acidic microenvironment that suppresses immune attack [1]. Metabolic plasticity thus gives melanoma a survival advantage, facilitating tumor progression and metastasis under varying conditions [2].

Beyond physiological microenvironment stressors, melanoma cells also rewire metabolism in response to therapeutic stress. A striking example is seen with BRAF/MEK inhibitors: many BRAF^V600E^-mutant melanomas adapt to these drugs by shifting from predominantly glycolytic metabolism to an oxidative, mitochondria-driven state [1]. This drug-induced metabolic switch is often mediated by upregulation of mitochondrial regulators (like PGC-1α) that enhance OXPHOS, and has been observed in a substantial subset of patients with targeted therapy resistance [1][3]. As a result, melanoma cells under treatment pressure can increase their energy production through OXPHOS and better neutralize reactive oxygen species, helping them survive the therapy. Consistent with this, advanced and therapy-resistant melanomas in both models and patients tend to exhibit higher reliance on mitochondrial respiration compared to early-stage tumors [3]. In summary, by flexibly modulating pathways such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, melanoma cells can adapt to low oxygen, nutrient deprivation, and drug exposure. This metabolic plasticity is a key non-genetic mechanism that promotes melanoma cell survival under stress and contributes to treatment failure [2][3].

Crucially, the same metabolic adaptations that help melanoma endure stress also offer potential targets for treatment. Since melanoma cells become reliant on certain pathways when they reprogram their metabolism, drugs that cut off those metabolic routes can selectively harm the tumor. Several metabolic vulnerabilities are being explored: for example, blocking glycolysis with agents like 2-deoxyglucose or inhibiting lactate transport, glutamine utilization, or fatty acid oxidation can starve melanoma cells of critical resources. Likewise, targeting mitochondrial energy production (OXPHOS) – using mitochondrial uncouplers or inhibitors like phenformin – can be effective, particularly in tumors that have shifted to a high-OXPHOS state [3]. Preclinical studies indicate that such metabolic interventions can impede melanoma growth and even enhance the efficacy of standard therapies. In one study, an OXPHOS-targeting drug (elesclomol) preferentially killed high-OXPHOS melanoma cells and improved the response to chemotherapy [3]. However, because of melanoma’s metabolic flexibility, targeting a single pathway often leads to compensation through an alternate route [2]. Tumor cells can reroute flux through parallel pathways (for instance, increasing glycolysis when OXPHOS is inhibited, or vice versa) to escape metabolic stalling [3]. This has motivated combined metabolic therapies aimed at shutting down multiple pathways simultaneously. Experimental evidence supports this strategy: concurrently inhibiting glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways produces greater anti-tumor effects, and melanoma cells that had become resistant to MAPK inhibitors were resensitized when both OXPHOS and glycolysis were co-targeted [2][3]. In fact, one approach simultaneously blocking three metabolic regulators (glycolysis via HIF-1α, mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α, and glutamine metabolism) caused a complete cessation of tumor growth in a model of melanoma, highlighting that multi-pronged metabolic inhibition can overcome the tumor’s adaptive capacity [3]. Overall, targeting the metabolic programs that melanoma cells use to adapt – especially through combination strategies that anticipate metabolic bypass loops – is a promising avenue to improve melanoma treatment outcomes [2][3].","Avagliano, A., Fiume, G., Pelagalli, A., Sanità, G., Ruocco, M.

These altered metabolic programs can be targeted for treatment, particularly through combination therapies designed to disrupt these adaptive mechanisms.

Melanoma, an aggressive cancer, utilizes metabolic reprogramming as a core survival mechanism against environmental pressures like nutrient scarcity, hypoxia, and therapeutic stress. This metabolic flexibility is a significant contributor to tumor progression, metastasis, and the development of treatment resistance. 
Melanoma Cell Adaptation to Environmental Stress
Melanoma cells demonstrate metabolic heterogeneity and the ability to transiently shift their metabolic profile in response to their environment and oncogenic mutations. Key adaptations include: 
Glycolytic Reliance: A common feature, linked to the Warburg effect and the activation of the BRAF/MAPK signaling pathway, is heightened glucose uptake and increased glycolysis. This provides rapid ATP and essential biosynthetic precursors (nucleotides, amino acids, lipids) for high proliferation rates. The lactate byproduct also acidifies the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting angiogenesis and immune evasion.
Oxidative Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) Activation: Under certain stresses, notably in metastatic or drug-resistant slow-cycling cells (often characterized by expression of the epigenetic factor JARID1B), melanoma cells shift towards increased mitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS). This high-OXPHOS state supports cell survival, invasion, and resistance to therapies that target fast-cycling cells.
Altered Lipid and Amino Acid Metabolism: Melanoma cells adapt their lipid metabolism, including de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation, to support membrane synthesis and energy storage, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis. They also exhibit altered glutamine utilization, with metastatic cells relying on glutamine oxidation to maintain OXPHOS activity.
Redox Balance Maintenance: Melanoma cells adapt to withstand oxidative stress by increasing their reliance on NADPH-generating enzymes, which helps manage the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during high mitochondrial activity. 
Targeting Metabolic Programs for Melanoma Treatment
Targeting these metabolic vulnerabilities is a promising therapeutic strategy, often most effective when combined with existing therapies (targeted or immune-based). 
Specific metabolic targets and strategies include:
Targeting Glycolysis: Inhibition of glycolytic enzymes can disrupt rapid ATP production and biomass synthesis.
Targeting Mitochondrial Function (OXPHOS):
Mitochondria-targeted drugs, such as the glutaminase 1 (GLS1) inhibitor BPTES (which blocks glutamine oxidation), can dramatically inhibit the migration of metastatic melanoma cells in vitro.
Inhibiting the transcriptional coactivator PGC1α (e.g., with XCT790 or SR-18292) has been shown to decrease mitochondrial mass and activity, impairing the clonogenic and invasive abilities of melanoma cells.
Targeting the Metabolism-Epigenetics Axis: The crosstalk between metabolism and epigenetic regulation offers innovative therapeutic opportunities. Metabolites like acetyl-CoA, glutamine, alpha-ketoglutarate, and lactate act as substrates or cofactors for epigenetic enzymes, meaning metabolic interventions can modulate gene expression and cell state.
Combination Therapies: Combining metabolic inhibitors with MAPK pathway inhibitors (BRAF/MEK inhibitors) or immunotherapies shows significant promise for enhancing efficacy and overcoming resistance. The metabolic changes induced by current therapies (e.g., increased OXPHOS after BRAF inhibitor treatment) reveal new vulnerabilities that can be exploited by combination strategies.
Dietary Interventions: Dietary modifications tailored to a patient's tumor profile (e.g., a low-oleic acid diet combined with an SCD inhibitor) have shown promise in preclinical models, suggesting a role for personalized nutrition in enhancing treatment outcomes.

61,Melanoma,What are the genetic and epigenetic features of brain metastases in melanoma associated with therapeutic responses? What are the mechanisms?,Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER: The primary genetic feature of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) associated with therapeutic response is the BRAF V600E mutation. This mutation is a biomarker for worse clinical outcomes, including decreased progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (PMID:37589977). However, patients with BRAF V600E mutant MBM respond favorably to targeted therapies like dabrafenib and trametinib, showing improved PFS (PMID:36477181). Conversely, the BRAF V600E mutation is associated with a poor response to immunotherapy. The mechanism for this resistance is linked to an intrinsically altered tumor microenvironment (TME), characterized by a lower tumor mutation burden and significantly reduced populations of T-cells and macrophages, making the tumors immunologically ""cold."" In contrast, BRAF wild-type MBMs have a more immune-infiltrated TME and are associated with a better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (PMID:37589977).

Epigenetic features, while less clearly defined, play a crucial role in MBM progression and adaptation. These features include global DNA hypomethylation and loci-specific hypermethylation, which regulate pathways involved in cell adhesion and immune response (PMID:28578692). Histone modifications, such as those mediated by the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3, promote metastasis by upregulating genes like CCL2, which is involved in macrophage recruitment to the TME (PMID:26729791). Key mechanisms of MBM adaptation to the brain microenvironment, likely driven by epigenetic reprogramming, have been identified as potential therapeutic targets. These include the secretion of amyloid beta (Aβ) by melanoma cells, which creates a pro-metastatic niche by activating astrocytes and inhibiting phagocytosis by microglia (PMID:35262173), and a metabolic shift toward enriched oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) accompanied by significant immunosuppression within the MBM (PMID:30787016).

ANALYSIS:
### **Investigation Report: Genetic and Epigenetic Determinants of Therapeutic Response in Melanoma Brain Metastases**

#### **1. Introduction**
Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) represent a significant clinical challenge, associated with high morbidity and mortality. The development of central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant systemic therapies has improved outcomes, but responses remain heterogeneous. A deeper understanding of the molecular landscape of these lesions is essential for optimizing patient selection, advancing treatment strategies, and identifying novel therapeutic targets. This report investigates the key genetic and epigenetic features of MBM, their association with responses to targeted therapy and immunotherapy, and the underlying biological mechanisms that govern these interactions.

#### **2. Genetic Features and Their Association with Therapeutic Response**

##### **2.1 The BRAF V600E Mutation as a Key Prognostic and Predictive Biomarker**
The BRAF V600E mutation is a defining genetic feature in a significant subset of melanoma brain metastases and serves as a critical biomarker for both prognosis and therapeutic response.

*   **Prognostic Significance:** A cohort study involving 94 patients with resected MBM found that the presence of a BRAF V600E alteration was significantly associated with worse clinical outcomes. Patients with BRAF V600E variant tumors had a shorter median intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) (3.6 months vs. 11.0 months for wild-type) and overall survival (OS) (9.8 months vs. 23.2 months for wild-type) (PMID:37589977).
*   **Impact on Survival:** Another study noted that the presence of brain metastasis has a negative impact on the long-term survival of patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma, but not in patients with BRAF-wildtype melanoma. This finding underscores the distinct tumor biology of BRAF-mutated MBM and highlights the need for new therapeutic approaches tailored to this molecular subtype (PMID:40028330).
*   **Role of NRAS Mutations:** In addition to BRAF, mutations in NRAS are also important for understanding treatment responses and survival outcomes in patients with MBM, necessitating molecular characterization of these tumors (PMID:29198052).

##### **2.2 Association of BRAF V600E with Therapeutic Response**
The BRAF V600E mutation dictates the response to two major classes of systemic therapy: targeted therapy and immunotherapy.

*   **Response to Targeted Therapy:** The COMBI-MB phase II study evaluated the efficacy of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with V600 BRAF-mutant MBM. The results showed that patients with a BRAF V600E genotype experienced improved PFS when treated with this combination therapy, demonstrating the direct actionability of this genetic target (PMID:36477181).
*   **Resistance to Immunotherapy and Underlying Mechanisms:** A comprehensive molecular analysis of resected MBM revealed a stark difference in immunotherapy response based on BRAF status. Patients with BRAF wild-type lesions demonstrated a significant survival benefit from postoperative immune checkpoint inhibition. In contrast, patients with BRAF V600E variant lesions showed no improvement in OS with immunotherapy (PMID:37589977). The study identified several mechanisms for this differential response:
    *   **Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB):** On a molecular level, BRAF V600E variant lesions were found to have a significantly decreased TMB (PMID:37589977).
    *   **Tumor Microenvironment (TME):** Single nuclear RNA sequencing revealed that the TME of BRAF V600E variant MBM is intrinsically different from that of BRAF wild-type tumors. BRAF V600E MBM harbored significantly fewer immune cells, with decreased populations of both T-cells and macrophages. This ""immune-cold"" microenvironment is believed to be a primary reason for the lack of efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in this subgroup (PMID:37589977).

These findings collectively establish the BRAF V600E alteration as a crucial translational biomarker. It identifies a patient population with a poor prognosis that benefits from CNS-penetrant targeted therapy but derives little benefit from standard immunotherapy, suggesting a need for alternative therapeutic strategies (PMID:37589977).

#### **3. Epigenetic and Molecular Features and Their Therapeutic Implications**

While the genetic landscape of MBM is dominated by BRAF mutations, epigenetic modifications and other molecular adaptations play a pivotal role in tumor progression, adaptation to the brain microenvironment, and therapeutic response.

##### **3.1 The Epigenetic Landscape in Melanoma Metastasis**
The epigenetic alterations in MBM are still not fully understood, but emerging evidence highlights their importance.

*   **DNA Methylation:** DNA methylation changes are a widespread feature of melanoma progression. This includes both global DNA hypomethylation and loci-specific hypermethylation affecting regulatory regions of genes. These changes can lead to the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or the abnormal re-expression of oncogenes (PMID:28578692). DNA methylation profiling of MBM from melanoma, lung, and breast cancer is being explored as a tool to identify novel, BM-specific epigenetic alterations that could serve as theranostic biomarkers (PMID:30398472). Integrative analysis has linked hypermethylation and gene downregulation to pathways involved in cell adhesion, while hypomethylation and overexpression are enriched in immune system and inflammatory processes, providing a direct link between epigenetics and TME modulation (PMID:28578692).
*   **Histone Methylation:** Histone modifications are another key epigenetic mechanism. The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase JMJD3 has been shown to promote melanoma progression and metastasis. Mechanistically, JMJD3 transcriptionally upregulates several targets of NF-κB and BMP signaling. One such target is the chemokine CCL2, which functions in macrophage recruitment, directly implicating this epigenetic regulator in shaping the TME. These findings suggest JMJD3 as a potential therapeutic target for melanoma treatment (PMID:26729791).

##### **3.2 Molecular Mechanisms of Adaptation and Novel Therapeutic Targets**
Melanoma cells must adapt to the unique microenvironment of the brain to survive and proliferate. Several molecular mechanisms underpinning this adaptation have been uncovered, revealing novel therapeutic vulnerabilities.

*   **Amyloid Beta (Aβ) Secretion:** An unbiased proteomics analysis revealed a novel mechanistic link between brain metastasis and Alzheimer's disease. Melanoma cells in brain metastases require amyloid beta (Aβ) for their growth and survival. The tumor cells secrete Aβ, which in turn activates surrounding astrocytes to a pro-metastatic, anti-inflammatory state and prevents microglia from phagocytosing the cancer cells. This demonstrates a critical mechanism of metastatic adaptation by suppressing neuroinflammation. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of Aβ was shown to decrease the brain metastatic burden, establishing Aβ as a promising therapeutic target for MBM (PMID:35262173).
*   **Metabolic and Immunosuppressive Reprogramming:** RNA sequencing of resected MBMs compared with patient-matched extracranial metastases identified distinct transcriptomic signatures. MBMs showed significant enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathways and profound immunosuppression. This metabolic shift and immune-cold environment appear to be key features of MBM biology, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention (PMID:30787016).

#### **4. Conclusion and Insights**
The genetic and epigenetic landscape of melanoma brain metastases is intricately linked to therapeutic responses, primarily through the modulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME).

The **BRAF V600E mutation** stands out as the most critical genetic biomarker. It predicts a poor prognosis and resistance to immunotherapy due to an intrinsically ""immune-cold"" TME with low TMB and sparse T-cell and macrophage infiltration. However, it also confers sensitivity to targeted BRAF/MEK inhibitors, making molecular testing essential for treatment stratification.

**Epigenetic modifications**, including DNA and histone methylation, orchestrate the gene expression programs that facilitate metastasis and shape the TME. These mechanisms regulate pathways controlling cell adhesion, inflammation, and immune cell recruitment. Furthermore, specific molecular adaptations allow MBM to thrive in the unique brain niche. The secretion of **amyloid beta** to suppress local neuroinflammation and a metabolic shift toward **oxidative phosphorylation** are key survival strategies that also represent novel and promising therapeutic targets.

A compelling insight from the collective evidence is the convergence of genetic and epigenetic events on the reprogramming of the TME. The BRAF V600E mutation appears to establish a foundational immune-excluded state, which is further shaped and maintained by epigenetic mechanisms and molecular adaptations. This suggests that the most effective future strategies for MBM, particularly for BRAF-mutant tumors, may require a multi-pronged approach. Such a strategy could involve combining CNS-penetrant targeted therapies to inhibit the primary oncogenic driver with novel agents that reverse the immunosuppressive TME, such as inhibitors of Aβ or OXPHOS, to potentially sensitize these tumors to immune checkpoint blockade.","1.

BRAF V600E mutation status, DNA methylation patterns (particularly CIMP and NGFR-associated programs), and immune microenvironment composition are the primary genetic and epigenetic features of melanoma brain metastases associated with therapeutic responses. BRAF V600E variant brain metastases demonstrate worse outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors due to decreased tumor mutation burden and immunosuppressive microenvironments, while BRAF wildtype lesions show superior responses to immunotherapy through enhanced immune infiltration and higher neoantigen presentation.

ANALYSIS:
BRAF Mutation Status and Therapeutic Response
BRAF V600E alteration is a critical biomarker negatively associated with immunotherapy response in melanoma brain metastases. Patients with BRAF V600E variant brain metastases demonstrate significantly worse intracranial progression-free survival (3.6 vs 11.0 months) and overall survival (9.8 vs 23.2 months) compared to BRAF wildtype tumors.
[1] BRAF wildtype lesions show significant benefit from checkpoint inhibition (median OS undefined with immunotherapy vs 13.0 months without, p=0.001), while BRAF variant lesions do not demonstrate improved survival with immunotherapy (9.8 vs 9.5 months, p=0.81).[1]

The underlying mechanism involves differential tumor mutation burden and immune microenvironment composition. BRAF V600E variant brain metastases harbor significantly decreased tumor mutation burden, resulting in fewer neoantigens for immune recognition.[1] Single nuclear RNA sequencing reveals that BRAF wildtype tumors contain significantly higher immune cell populations (11% vs 3% CD45-positive cells, p=0.04), with enriched T-cell and macrophage infiltrates that correlate with immunotherapy responsiveness.[1]

Epigenetic Phenotype Switching and Treatment Resistance

The expression of E-cadherin (Ecad) versus NGFR subdivides melanoma brain metastases into proliferative/pigmented versus invasive/stem-like/therapy-resistant phenotypes, irrespective of intracranial location.[2] Switching from Ecad-associated into NGFR-associated programs during progression represents a rate-limiting process indicating drug response and intracranial progression states.[2] NGFR-associated programs control cell migration and proliferation via downstream transcription factors such as SOX4, and this phenotypic switch correlates with resistance to MAPK inhibitors.[2]

Analysis of MAPK inhibitor-naive versus refractory melanoma brain metastases reveals that progression is characterized by this Ecad-to-NGFR phenotype transition, suggesting that monitoring these epigenetic programs could predict therapeutic resistance before clinical progression.[2]

DNA Methylation Landscape and Treatment Outcomes

Integrated multi-omics profiling identifies four DNA methylation subtypes (DEMethylated, LOW, INTermediate, and CIMP) with progressively increasing methylation levels that predict therapeutic responses.[3] Patients with LOW methylation tumors exhibit significantly longer relapse-free survival following adjuvant immune checkpoint blockade compared to those with INT/CIMP lesions. [3]

LOW methylation brain metastases demonstrate enrichment for CD8+ TCF-1+ PD-1+ TIM-3- pre-exhausted T cells and CD8+ TCF-1- PD-1+ TIM-3+ exhausted T cells, more frequent retention of HLA Class I antigens, and a de-differentiated melanoma phenotype—all features associated with immunotherapy responsiveness.[3] In contrast, CIMP tumors show opposite activation of master regulatory molecules and differential expression of immunotherapy response signatures.[3]

Treatment with DNMT inhibitors induces global DNA demethylation in differentiated melanoma cell lines, promotes dedifferentiation, and upregulates viral mimicry and IFNG predictive signatures of immunotherapy response, suggesting that epigenetic modulation could sensitize resistant tumors to checkpoint inhibition.[3]

Site-Specific Epigenetic Reprogramming

Integrated methylome and transcriptome analysis identified 38 genes with differential promoter methylation and corresponding expression changes specific to intracranial versus extracranial metastases.[4] Validated proteins including phosphorylated PRKCZ, PRKCZ, and phosphorylated GRB10 create a brain-specific phenotype characterized by increased AKT phosphorylation and higher proliferation rates.[4] Knockdown of PRKCZ or GRB10 decreased viability of brain-specific melanoma cell lines, suggesting these epigenetically regulated pathways represent therapeutic vulnerabilities.[4]

Global methylome profiling uncovered 46 differentially methylated regions discriminating BRAF and wildtype melanoma brain metastases, with patient-specific methylation patterns affecting cytokine signaling, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and ECM signaling pathways.[5] Genes frequently affected by differential methylation (JAK3, MECOM, TNXB) show strong associations between gene body methylation alterations and corresponding expression changes.[5]

Immune Microenvironment Features

Melanoma brain metastases demonstrate heterogeneity of immune infiltrates that correlates with post-craniotomy survival.[6] Immunosuppression is significantly enriched in brain metastases compared to patient-matched extracranial metastases, with increased proportions of immune-suppressive M2 macrophages compared to tumor-suppressive M1 macrophages in both intracranial and extracranial sites.[7-8]

Single-cell transcriptomics reveals that treatment-naive melanoma brain metastases harbor larger fractions of monocyte-derived macrophages and dysfunctional TOX+ CD8+ T cells with distinct expression of immune checkpoints.[9] Brain metastases show T-cell exhaustion with elevated PD-1, HAVCR2, and LAG3 expression, along with regulatory T-cell enrichment.[10]

Microglial reprogramming represents a novel therapeutic target: activation of the Rela/NF-κB pathway in microglia promotes melanoma brain metastasis, while targeting this pathway elicits microglial reprogramming toward a proinflammatory phenotype that enhances antitumor immunity.[11] Proinflammatory microglial markers are associated with improved responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and targeting Rela/NF-κB improves checkpoint inhibitor responses in preclinical models.[11]

Metabolic Reprogramming and Therapeutic Implications

Melanoma brain metastases demonstrate significant enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) compared to extracranial metastases.[6] Gene expression analysis confirmed increased OXPHOS gene expression in brain metastases, which was validated by direct metabolite profiling and glucose tracing.[6] IACS-010759, an OXPHOS inhibitor, improved survival in mice bearing MAPK inhibitor-resistant intracranial melanoma xenografts and inhibited brain metastasis formation in spontaneous models, suggesting metabolic targeting as a strategy for resistant disease.[6]

Autophagy signaling pathways are upregulated in melanoma brain metastases versus lymph node and skin metastases, driven primarily by upregulation of GFAP and HBB, which may reflect tumor microenvironment changes.[7-8] This autophagy enrichment represents another potential therapeutic vulnerability.

Additional Prognostic Biomarkers

Higher tumor mutation burden is significantly associated with better prognosis in brain metastases and correlates with immunotherapy response.[12] PTPRT mutation associates with improved prognosis and better immunotherapy response.[12] Copy number alterations show prognostic significance, with PTEN deletion associated with poorer outcomes and DUSP4 deletion with better outcomes.[12]

MET receptor activation through stromal HGF release represents a resistance mechanism, particularly in BRAF inhibitor-resistant or BRAF wildtype tumors.[13] MET inhibitors demonstrate marked responses in brain metastasis-derived cell lines lacking druggable BRAF mutations, suggesting MET targeting as a therapeutic strategy for resistant intracranial disease.[13]

Clinical Translation

These molecular features inform treatment selection: BRAF V600E variant brain metastases may benefit from combination BRAF/MEK inhibition (dabrafenib/trametinib) rather than immunotherapy monotherapy, while BRAF wildtype lesions show superior responses to checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, ipilimumab)(FDA)","1.

14. FDA Orange Book.","Melanoma brain metastases (MBM) are characterized by high mutational burdens with common driver mutations (e.g. BRAF^V600E, NRAS) and additional genetic alterations that influence therapy outcomes. Approximately half of MBMs harbor BRAF^V600E mutations, which are targetable by BRAF/MEK inhibitors and also correlate with distinct tumor microenvironments and immunotherapy response patterns【1】. In fact, BRAF^V600E has been identified as a key biomarker in MBM, associated with more aggressive disease but also greater benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors in treated patients【1】. Other frequent genomic events in MBM include losses of tumor suppressors like PTEN and chromosomal instability, which can foster therapy resistance. For example, PTEN loss – observed in a subset of MBMs – may promote an immune-evasive, angiogenic tumor milieu that undermines immunotherapy efficacy【2】. Overall, the spectrum of mutations in MBM largely overlaps with extracranial metastases, but brain-specific evolutionary changes (such as new subclonal driver mutations or copy-number alterations) can arise and may affect treatment response【2】.

Epigenetic reprogramming is a hallmark of melanoma brain metastasis and also modulates therapeutic outcomes. MBM cells often undergo phenotype switching and epigenetic adaptations to thrive in the brain’s unique environment. Notably, recent single-cell and methylation analyses have shown that melanoma cells in the brain activate a “neuronal-like” gene expression program, distinguishing them from primary tumors【3】. This epigenetic shift can enhance their survival behind the blood–brain barrier but may also confer drug resistance. For instance, MBM cells in a slow-cycling, de-differentiated state (linked to chromatin remodeling) are less sensitive to MAPK pathway inhibitors, whereas a more differentiated/proliferative state can be associated with better drug response. Indeed, autophagy and stress-response pathways are epigenetically upregulated in MBM relative to extracranial lesions【2】, which may help tumor cells resist targeted therapies and survive in a nutrient-deprived microenvironment. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications in MBM can affect immune recognition – for example, global DNA methylation changes may silence antigen-presentation machinery, contributing to immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance (though adjunct epigenetic therapies can potentially reverse this and improve immunogenicity).

Mechanistically, several genetic and epigenetic features of MBM directly impact therapeutic responses:

BRAF^V600 Mutation: This defining genetic feature drives MAPK hyperactivation and is present in ~50% of MBMs【1】. Its presence predicts response to targeted therapy (BRAF±MEK inhibitors often achieve high initial intracranial response rates). However, MBMs frequently acquire additional mutations or epigenetic alterations (e.g. upregulation of alternative signaling pathways) that confer resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors over time. Combination approaches – including adding immune therapy – have shown improved intracranial control in BRAF-mutant cases, reflecting the complex interplay between genotype and treatment response【1】.

NRAS and Other Mutations: NRAS-mutant MBMs (seen in ~15–20% of patients) lack a direct targeted therapy but often have very high UV-induced mutation burdens【4】. The high neoantigen load in these tumors is linked to better responsiveness to immunotherapy. Indeed, MBMs generally have among the highest tumor mutational burdens in oncology, a factor associated with improved checkpoint inhibitor efficacy. In clinical series, long-term survivors on immunotherapy often have tumors with rich neoantigen landscapes, whereas those with low mutation burden or genomic WNT/β-catenin activation (an immune-evasive pathway) respond poorly to immunotherapy.

PTEN Loss and PI3K Activation: Loss-of-function mutations or deletions in PTEN are enriched in metastatic melanoma and especially in brain metastases【2】. PTEN loss leads to unchecked PI3K–AKT signaling, which not only promotes tumor cell survival under therapy but also creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment (via increased VEGF and inhibitory cytokines). Clinically, PTEN-deficient MBMs have shown lower T-cell infiltration and reduced benefit from PD-1 blockade in some studies. This illustrates how a genetic alteration can mechanistically drive therapy resistance: by both cell-intrinsic resistance to apoptosis and extrinsic evasion of immune attack.

Epigenetic Plasticity and Therapy Resistance: Melanoma cells are highly plastic, able to switch between distinct transcriptional states. In MBM, epigenetic regulators (histone modifiers, DNA methylation enzymes) help induce a stem-like, invasive phenotype under therapeutic stress. For example, histone methylation changes can downregulate MITF and upregulate receptor tyrosine kinases (AXL, etc.), yielding a drug-resistant, mesenchymal state. This phenotype switching, driven by chromatin remodeling, has been observed during BRAF inhibitor treatment and is linked to the emergence of brain metastases despite systemic therapy【5】. Likewise, epigenetic silencing of APM (antigen presentation machinery) genes (via promoter hypermethylation) can allow melanoma cells in the CNS to escape immune detection, limiting the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors. Drugs like DNA methyltransferase inhibitors or HDAC inhibitors can reverse some of these changes, restoring sensitivity, and such combinations are under exploration in refractory MBM.

Microenvironmental Epigenetic Interactions: The brain niche imposes additional selective pressures leading to unique mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Melanoma cells in the brain often co-opt astrocytes and microglia through signaling crosstalk. A striking example is the transfer of the second messenger cGAMP from tumor to astrocytes via gap junctions (connexin43); this activates the STING pathway in astrocytes, causing them to secrete IFNα and TNFα, which paradoxically promote tumor cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy【6】. This gap-junction-mediated mechanism illustrates how epigenetic activation of inflammatory pathways can end up shielding tumor cells from therapy-induced death. Additionally, MBM cells secrete factors like amyloid β to epigenetically reprogramme the microenvironment – recent research showed melanoma-secreted amyloid β induces a neuroinflammatory suppression, “educating” microglia toward a wound-healing, tumor-supportive phenotype【7】. By dampening pro-inflammatory microglial activity, the tumor reduces immune surveillance in the brain, which can undermine immunotherapy. Targeting such epigenetically modulated microenvironmental interactions (for instance, using STING agonists or inhibiting astrocytic support signals) is an emerging therapeutic strategy.

In summary, the genetic and epigenetic landscape of melanoma brain metastases profoundly influences therapeutic response. Key driver mutations like BRAF shape the choice and success of targeted therapies, while co-mutations (PTEN, others) and copy-number changes modulate sensitivity to both targeted and immune-based treatments【1】【2】. Simultaneously, epigenetic features – from global methylation patterns to tumor cell phenotype plasticity – dictate how MBM cells adapt to the brain niche and evade therapies【3】【2】. Mechanistically, these alterations enable melanoma cells to resist apoptosis (via alternative signaling and autophagy), hide from immune attack (via antigen downregulation and immunosuppressive secretions), and thrive alongside reactive glial cells【6】【7】. Understanding these genetic and epigenetic determinants has direct clinical implications: for example, patients with BRAF-mutant MBM may benefit from upfront combination immunotherapy【1】, and trials are exploring epigenetic drugs to reverse resistance phenotypes. Ongoing research continues to decode this complex biology, with the aim of tailoring therapies to the molecular profile of MBM and disrupting the mechanisms by which these metastases subvert treatment.","Feng R., et al.

Key features include the BRAF V600E mutation, the loss of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A and PTEN, and dynamic epigenetic reprogramming involving phenotype switching and DNA methylation changes which allow cancer cells to adapt to the brain microenvironment and evade treatment.

The response of melanoma brain metastases (MBM) to therapies is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic mutations and reversible epigenetic modifications. 
Genetic Features Associated with Therapeutic Responses
BRAF V600E Mutation: The BRAF V600E alteration is a significant genetic biomarker in MBM.
It is associated with worse clinical outcomes, including reduced intracranial progression-free survival and overall survival.
BRAF V600E variant MBMs often have fewer infiltrating immune cell types (e.g., CD8+ cells) compared to BRAF wild-type lesions.
Patients with BRAF wild-type MBMs may benefit more from immunotherapy, while BRAF V600E patients may require alternative, central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant systemic regimens such as targeted therapy combinations.
Tumor Suppressor Gene Alterations:
High rates of copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are found in tumor suppressor genes, notably CDKN2A/B (59% CNV rate) and PTEN (31% CNV rate).
Loss of PTEN expression can lead to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is a mechanism of resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors (BRAFi/MEKi).
Other Mutations: MBMs harbor other actionable mutations in genes like NRAS, CDK4, and EIF1AX. 
Epigenetic Features and Mechanisms of Resistance
Epigenetic mechanisms contribute significantly to tumor heterogeneity, cellular plasticity, and acquired therapy resistance in MBM. 
Phenotype Switching: A key non-genetic mechanism involves cellular plasticity and a reversible phenotype switch, particularly from an E-cadherin (Ecad)-associated, proliferative/pigmented state to an NGFR-associated, invasive/stem-like/therapy-resistant state. This switch is associated with intracranial progression and potential drug response states.
DNA Methylation Changes:
Melanoma progression to MBM is associated with progressive genome-wide demethylation in low CpG density regions and increased methylation in CpG islands.
Specific differentially methylated regions, including the HOXD9 gene promoter, are higher in MBM than in earlier stages, affecting gene expression.
The brain microenvironment can influence DNA methylation patterns; for instance, interactions with reactive astrocytes can suppress DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1), which activates survival signals and contributes to the persistence of indolent cancer cells in the brain, thereby promoting resistance.
Microenvironmental Influence (Non-cell-autonomous mechanisms): The brain microenvironment actively drives epigenetic and molecular changes.
Astrocytes secrete exosomes containing PTEN-targeting microRNAs (miRNAs), leading to the silencing of PTEN in melanoma cells and activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, thus promoting metastasis and resistance to therapies.
Melanoma cells secrete Amyloid Beta (Aβ) peptides which trigger local astrocytes to adopt a pro-metastatic, anti-inflammatory phenotype, protecting cancer cells from immune clearance by microglia. 
These genetic and epigenetic alterations facilitate MBM cells' adaptation to the unique CNS environment and help them evade targeted therapies and immunotherapies, resulting in reduced durations of response compared to extracranial metastases.

62,Melanoma,What are the genetic and epigenetic features of melanoma to determine the organ tropism of metastasis?,Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER:
The organ tropism of melanoma metastasis is determined by a complex interplay of intrinsic genetic and epigenetic features of the tumor cells, as well as their interactions with the microenvironment of the target organ. Genetic features include key driver mutations like BRAF and PTEN that initiate metastatic potential, along with distinct, organ-specific genetic alterations found in established metastases. Epigenetic mechanisms provide the cellular plasticity required for metastasis, primarily through the reprogramming of gene expression associated with processes like the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

**Genetic Features:**
- **Driver Mutations and Metastatic Potential:** The mutational activation of BRAF, often in combination with the silencing of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, is a critical event that drives melanoma development and subsequent metastasis to lymph nodes and lungs (PMID:19282848). Specifically, BRAF mutations are clinically associated with an increased frequency of metastasis to regional lymph nodes (PMID:20874733). BRAF mutations are also associated with metastasis to the brain and liver (PMID:32368388).
- **Organ-Specific Genetic Signatures:** Analysis of visceral metastases has revealed organ-specific genetic alterations. Lung metastases are characterized by copy number gains in multiple immunogenic genes, suggesting a strong immunologic selection process. Brain metastases show amplifications of HGF and MET genes, indicating a potential autocrine signaling loop. Liver metastases contain amplifications of CDK6 and MAPK genes (PMID:35628196). Clinico-genomic analysis of over 7,000 patients identified distinct metastatic patterns, with clusters of patients showing tropism for the brain, lung, or liver, in addition to highly metastatic or low metastatic (lymph node) patterns (PMID:39975034).
- **Pre-Metastatic Niche Formation:** Tumor cells can prime distant organs for metastasis. For lung tropism, primary tumor-derived exosomal RNAs can activate Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in lung epithelial cells, inducing chemokine secretion and neutrophil recruitment to form a pre-metastatic niche (PMID:27505671).

**Epigenetic Features:**
- **Histone Modifications:** The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase JMJD3 is essential for melanoma metastasis. It promotes malignant features such as enhanced clonogenicity, self-renewal, and transendothelial migration by transcriptionally upregulating targets of NF-κB and BMP signaling, including STC1 and CCL2 (PMID:26729791).
- **DNA Methylation:** Metastatic progression is accompanied by changes in DNA methylation. The metastasis driver NR2F2-Iso2, which is normally silenced by DNA methylation in differentiated melanocytes, becomes increasingly hypomethylated and re-expressed during melanoma progression. This re-expression drives EMT- and neural crest cell (NCC)-like features, facilitating metastatic spread (PMID:37015919).
- **Epigenetic Reprogramming in EMT:** EMT, a key process for metastasis, involves widespread epigenetic reprogramming. This includes a global reduction in the heterochromatin mark H3K9Me2 and an increase in the euchromatin mark H3K4Me3, regulated by enzymes like lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1). These changes are critical for EMT-driven cell migration (PMID:21725293).

In conclusion, specific genetic mutations and amplifications appear to steer metastatic melanoma cells toward particular organs. This organ tropism is enabled by profound epigenetic reprogramming that confers the cellular plasticity, migratory capacity, and invasive potential necessary for tumor cells to leave the primary site, survive in circulation, and colonize distant tissues.

ANALYSIS:
**An Investigation into the Genetic and Epigenetic Determinants of Melanoma Metastatic Organ Tropism**

**1. Genetic Features of Melanoma Metastasis**

**1.1. Key Driver Mutations and Metastatic Potential**
The progression of melanoma from a primary tumor to metastatic disease is driven by a succession of genetic alterations. The mutational activation of *BRAF* is identified as one of the earliest and most frequent genetic events in melanoma (PMID:19282848). However, this mutation alone is often insufficient to cause malignant progression.
- In a mouse model with conditional melanocyte-specific expression of *BRaf(V600E)*, mice developed only benign melanocytic hyperplasias. In contrast, when *BRaf(V600E)* expression was combined with the silencing of the *Pten* tumor suppressor gene, it resulted in the development of melanoma with 100% penetrance and short latency. Importantly, these melanomas exhibited metastases in the lymph nodes and lungs, establishing this genetic combination as a potent driver of metastasis (PMID:19282848).
- Clinical studies support these findings, demonstrating that primary cutaneous melanomas with *BRAF* mutations not only show characteristic morphological features but also metastasize more frequently to regional lymph nodes compared to melanomas without this mutation (PMID:20874733).
- The order of genetic events during melanoma progression has been defined, typically initiating with mutations activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, such as *BRAF V600E*. This is often followed by *TERT* promoter mutations at an early stage, biallelic inactivation of *CDKN2A* in invasive melanomas, and finally, *PTEN* and *TP53* mutations in advanced primary melanomas. This step-wise accumulation of mutations, heavily influenced by ultraviolet radiation, drives the evolution towards an invasive, metastatic phenotype (PMID:26559571).

**1.2. Transcriptional Signatures and Resistance**
Beyond individual mutations, specific transcriptional signatures in primary tumors can predict metastatic behavior and resistance to therapy.
- An analysis of pretreatment melanoma biopsies identified a transcriptional signature, termed IPRES (innate anti-PD-1 resistance), in tumors that are innately resistant to PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. This signature indicates the concurrent upregulation of genes involved in mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis—all processes critically involved in metastasis. Notably, treatment with MAPK inhibitors can induce a similar signature, suggesting a link between therapy resistance and metastatic potential (PMID:26997480).

**1.3. Genetic Determinants of Organ-Specific Metastasis (Organ Tropism)**
While some mutations confer a general metastatic potential, other genetic features appear to direct melanoma cells to specific organs.
- A large-scale analysis of over 7,000 patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma identified five distinct metastatic patterns through unsupervised machine learning. These included a ""highly metastatic"" cluster with spread to many organs, a ""low metastatic"" cluster primarily involving lymph nodes, and three clusters characterized by specific metastasis to the brain, lung, or liver. The study also found that older age was associated with an increased likelihood of lung and adrenal metastases (PMID:39975034).
- A review article specified that mutations in *BRAF* are associated with metastasis to lymph nodes, the brain, and the liver, directly linking a common driver mutation to tropism for several organs (PMID:32368388).
- Analysis of visceral metastases has uncovered unique genetic alterations specific to the site of metastasis. Lung metastases exhibit copy number gains in 19 different immunogenic genes, pointing towards a strong immunologic selection pressure in the lung microenvironment. In contrast, brain metastases are characterized by amplifications of the *HGF* and *MET* genes, suggesting the presence of a targetable autocrine signaling loop. Liver metastases were found to have amplifications of the *CDK6* and *MAPK* genes (PMID:35628196).
- The tumor can actively prepare a distant organ for colonization through the formation of a pre-metastatic niche. One mechanism for lung-specific metastasis involves primary tumor-derived exosomal RNAs, which are enriched in small nuclear RNAs. These exosomes are sensed by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) on lung epithelial cells, triggering the secretion of chemokines that promote neutrophil recruitment and establish a favorable niche for incoming tumor cells (PMID:27505671).
- The concept of ""tumor self-seeding"" reveals that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can colonize their tumor of origin. This process is preferentially mediated by aggressive CTCs that already exhibit tropism for bone, lung, or brain metastasis. Factors secreted by these ""self-seeding"" cells, such as the chemokine CXCL1, can accelerate tumor growth and angiogenesis (PMID:20064377).

**1.4. Genetics of Specific Melanoma Subtypes**
Different clinical subtypes of melanoma have distinct genetic landscapes, which may influence their metastatic behavior, although direct links to organ tropism are not always specified.
- Melanocytic neoplasms with fusion genes involving protein kinase C (*PRKCA*, *PRKCB*, *PRKCG*) can progress to melanomas, particularly with the inactivation of *BAP1*, and subsequently metastasize (PMID:37474004).
- Acral and mucosal melanomas, which are not linked to UV radiation, share aggressive phenotypes and similar genetic landscapes (PMID:34149718, PMID:37913653).
- A large whole-genome sequencing study confirmed that while cutaneous, acral, and mucosal melanomas share alterations in core pathways like MAPK and PI3K, the specific mechanisms activating or inactivating these pathways vary between subtypes. Uveal melanoma was found to be genomically distinct from the other subtypes (PMID:36098958).

**2. Epigenetic Features of Melanoma Metastasis**

**2.1. Histone Modifications and Metastatic Phenotypes**
Epigenetic modifications, particularly those affecting histones, play a key role in regulating the gene expression programs that drive metastasis.
- The histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase JMJD3 has been shown to be required for melanoma growth and metastasis. While it does not alter the general proliferation rate in vitro, JMJD3 confers several malignant features, including enhanced clonogenicity, self-renewal, and transendothelial migration. Mechanistically, JMJD3 transcriptionally upregulates targets of NF-κB and BMP signaling, such as stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), which act as downstream effectors promoting self-renewal and macrophage recruitment, respectively (PMID:26729791).

**2.2. DNA Methylation and Metastatic Progression**
Changes in DNA methylation patterns are a crucial feature of metastatic progression, allowing tumor cells to reactivate developmental gene programs.
- Metastatic melanoma is characterized by the de-differentiation of melanocytic cells into a migratory state with features resembling neural crest cells (NCC) and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A key driver of this process is the epigenetically regulated gene *NR2F2-Iso2*. This isoform is normally silenced by DNA methylation as NCCs differentiate into melanocytes. During metastatic progression, this process is reversed; *NR2F2-Iso2* becomes increasingly hypomethylated and is re-expressed. This re-expression modulates the activity of full-length NR2F2 over EMT- and NCC-associated target genes, facilitating the cell state transitions required for metastatic spread (PMID:37015919).

**2.3. Epigenetic Reprogramming during Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)**
EMT is a critical process for metastasis that involves profound, Lsd1-dependent epigenetic reprogramming.
- During EMT induced by TGF-β, widespread changes in chromatin modifications occur. This includes a global reduction in the heterochromatin mark H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9Me2) and an increase in the euchromatin mark H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4Me3) and the transcriptional mark H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36Me3). These changes depend on the enzyme lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1), and loss of Lsd1 function has significant effects on EMT-driven cell migration and chemoresistance (PMID:21725293).
- The susceptibility of cancer cells to ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent cell death, is linked to their EMT status, which is under epigenetic control. The expression of EMT markers like E-cadherin and ZEB1 is associated with ferroptosis sensitivity. Epigenetic modulation of EMT through histone deacetylase SIRT1, miR-200 family members, or DNA methylation of the *CDH1* gene can alter a cell's mesenchymal state and thereby its susceptibility to ferroptosis inducers (PMID:32896720).

**2.4. Epigenetic Regulation of Organ-Specific Homing Mechanisms**
While most evidence links epigenetics to the acquisition of general metastatic capabilities, there are principles of epigenetically controlled organ homing that may be relevant to melanoma.
- A study on natural killer (NK) cell homing identified the CCRL2/chemerin/CMKLR1 axis as a selective pathway for lung homing. The expression of CCRL2 on lung capillary endothelial cells is epigenetically regulated and can be upregulated by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. While this finding relates to immune cell trafficking, it establishes a paradigm where epigenetic regulation of homing receptors within a target organ's endothelium can control cell-specific recruitment to that site, a mechanism that could potentially be co-opted by tumor cells (PMID:37343073).","1.

Genetic and epigenetic features that determine melanoma organ tropism include site-specific mutations (SETD2 for adrenal, PTEN for brain, NRAS for liver avoidance), epigenetic reprogramming of genes like PRKCZ and GRB10 in brain metastases, and stromal lipid-driven metabolic states that direct metastatic seeding patterns. These molecular determinants create distinct organ-specific phenotypes that shape where melanoma cells preferentially metastasize and successfully colonize.

ANALYSIS:

Genetic Determinants of Organ Tropism

Specific genetic alterations show strong associations with metastatic site preference. SETD2 mutations are significantly enriched in adrenal metastases (HR 2.4-2.6, p<0.005), while PTEN loss is associated with both brain (OR 3.00, p<0.0001) and small intestine metastases (OR 3.46).[1-2] Conversely, NRAS mutations correlate with reduced liver metastasis risk (HR 0.58-0.59, p<0.01).[1-2] Brain metastases demonstrate enrichment for CDKN2A variants (OR 1.56) and frequent loss of chromosome 9p21, which may predict higher brain metastatic potential.[2-3]

Lung metastases exhibit a distinct genetic profile characterized by NF1 mutation enrichment (OR 2.57, p<0.0001), TP53 variants (OR 1.65), and depletion of NRAS mutations (OR 0.49).[2] These lung metastases also show higher UV mutational signatures, elevated tumor mutational burden, and increased PD-L1 positivity compared to other sites.[2] Copy number variations demonstrate organ-specific patterns, with brain metastases showing predominant copy number losses (including DNA damage response genes), while lung metastases display ""immunogenic mimicry"" through amplification of immune genes.[3]

Epigenetic Mechanisms Driving Organotropism

Brain metastases exhibit distinct epigenetic reprogramming compared to extracranial sites. Integrated methylome and transcriptome analysis identified 38 genes with differential promoter methylation and corresponding expression changes specific to intracranial metastases.[4] Key validated proteins include STK10, PDXK, WDR24, CSSP1, NMB, RASL11B, phosphorylated PRKCZ, PRKCZ, and phosphorylated GRB10, which collectively create a brain-specific phenotype characterized by increased AKT phosphorylation and higher proliferation rates.[4] Knockdown of PRKCZ or GRB10 decreased viability of brain-specific melanoma cell lines, suggesting these epigenetically regulated pathways are functionally critical for brain colonization.[4]

NT5E (CD73) methylation status correlates with metastatic site specificity: primary melanomas lacking NT5E methylation more commonly relapse with visceral and brain metastases, while those with NT5E methylation show limited metastatic potential or preferentially metastasize to lymph nodes rather than viscera (p=0.01).[5] This epigenetic mark may serve as a biomarker distinguishing aggressive visceral/brain-tropic disease from more indolent nodal-predominant patterns.[5]

Metabolic and Microenvironmental Influences

Stromal lipid composition profoundly influences both metastatic burden and organ tropism.[6] Young subcutaneous adipocytes provide abundant phosphatidylcholines that upregulate melanoma PI3K-AKT signaling, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), resulting in oxidative stress and decreased metastatic burden.[6] High OXPHOS melanoma cells predominantly seed lung and brain, while reducing oxidative stress with antioxidants shifts tropism from lung to liver.[6]

In contrast, aged tumor microenvironments provide fewer total lipids but are enriched in ceramides, leading to lower OXPHOS and high metastatic burden.[6] Aged microenvironment ceramides activate the S1P-STAT3-IL-6 signaling axis in melanoma cells and promote liver tropism.[6] Inhibiting OXPHOS in young microenvironments or blocking IL-6 receptor in aged microenvironments reduces age-specific metastatic patterns, demonstrating that lipid-driven metabolic states are therapeutically targetable determinants of organotropism.[6]

Phenotype Switching and EMT Programs

Gene co-expression modules associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis correlate with organ-specific colonization patterns.[7] Histone modification signatures, including reduced H4K5ac and H4K8ac in pre-malignant cells and altered H3K4, H3K56, and H4K20 methylation patterns related to EMT, contribute to metastatic competence.[7] Brain-metastatic melanoma cells show higher H3K9me2 and H3K36me3 methylation with downregulation of the H3K36me2 methyltransferase NSD1.[7]

Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that metastatic potential correlates with MITF/AXL pathway expression patterns, with lung metastatic cells expressing intermediate profiles between primary and brain metastatic phenotypes.[8] The PC2 signature (positively associated with MITF, negatively with AXL) segregates cell types and predicts prognosis, with PC2-high tumors showing significantly worse outcomes (p=0.003).[8]

Site-Specific Copy Number Alterations

Organ-specific copy number variations further define tropism patterns. Melanomas of the oral cavity frequently show chromosome 5p gains with TERT amplification (8/10 cases), while nasal cavity melanomas are enriched for 11q amplifications (7/16).[3][9] Paranasal sinus melanomas universally demonstrate PTEN loss (9/9), predominantly through promoter methylation.[9] Brain metastases exhibit autocrine c-MET activation and correlation between BRAF gene copy number and mutant allele frequency, particularly in lung metastases.[3]

Clinical and Therapeutic Implications

These organ-specific molecular features have important therapeutic implications. TERT promoter and BRAF mutations are risk factors for hematogenous metastasis, with synergistic effects when simultaneously present, supporting adjuvant targeted therapy for patients carrying these mutations.[10] The distinct genetic and epigenetic landscapes across metastatic sites suggest that biopsy of accessible metastases may not fully represent the molecular heterogeneity of disease at other sites, potentially impacting treatment selection.[11-12]

Understanding organotropism mechanisms reveals potential therapeutic vulnerabilities: targeting PRKCZ/GRB10 signaling in brain metastases, modulating OXPHOS or IL-6 receptor based on patient age and lipid microenvironment, or exploiting site-specific epigenetic dependencies could improve outcomes in metastatic melanoma.[4-6]","1.

Leading Journal","Melanoma exhibits distinct genetic and epigenetic alterations that influence where it metastasizes. Certain genomic mutations endow melanoma cells with a greater ability to colonize specific organs. For example, loss-of-function mutations in PTEN and B2M (β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin) are associated with a higher overall metastatic burden, and notably PTEN loss correlates with an increased incidence of brain metastases [1][2]. In contrast, mutations in G-protein subunits GNAQ/GNA11 – common drivers of uveal melanoma – can confer a liver-tropic phenotype even in cutaneous melanoma, predisposing tumors to metastasize to the liver [1]. Importantly, these genetic factors help define “organotropic” metastatic patterns; unsupervised clustering of thousands of melanoma cases has identified subgroups of patients whose metastases predominantly localize to specific sites (e.g. brain-only, lung-only, or liver-only patterns), reflecting underlying genomic differences [1].

Epigenetic reprogramming in melanoma further determines organ tropism of metastasis. DNA methylation landscapes evolve as melanoma progresses to distant sites. Metastatic progression is marked by global DNA hypomethylation in low-CpG-density regions alongside focal hypermethylation of certain gene promoters [3]. Notably, melanomas metastasizing to the brain show differential methylation of developmental regulators – for instance, the HOXD9 gene becomes epigenetically dysregulated. In brain metastases, the HOXD9 promoter region exhibits altered methylation (part of a brain-specific partially methylated domain), and low methylation (gene activation) in this region is associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis [3]. Such epigenetic plasticity may facilitate melanoma cells adopting organ-specific traits needed to thrive in a given microenvironment.

Additionally, microRNA (miRNA) profiles in the primary tumor can forecast metastatic organ tropism. A seminal study identified a four-miRNA signature (downregulation of miR-150-5p, miR-15b-5p, miR-16-5p, and miR-374b-3p) in primary melanomas that specifically predicted later brain metastases [4]. Patients whose tumors had low levels of these miRNAs – especially miR-150-5p, a microRNA linked to immune cell presence – were far more likely to develop brain mets [4]. This indicates that epigenetic regulators like miRNAs can endow melanoma cells with a predilection for certain organs (in this case, the central nervous system). In summary, melanoma’s metastatic organ tropism is governed by a combination of tumor-intrinsic genetic alterations (e.g. PTEN, B2M, GNAQ/GNA11 mutations) and epigenetic modifications (such as DNA methylation changes and organ-specific miRNA expression patterns) that collectively direct melanoma cells to preferred metastatic sites.

Melanoma is notorious for its ability to metastasize widely, but emerging evidence shows that the pattern of organ involvement is not random – it is shaped by specific genetic and epigenetic features of the tumor. On the genetic level, mutations that arise during melanoma progression can increase the propensity for metastasis and even bias the “seed” towards particular “soils” (organs). One clear example is the PTEN tumor suppressor. PTEN loss is common in advanced melanomas and has been linked to enhanced PI3K–AKT signaling and aggressive behavior. Clinically, complete loss of PTEN protein in melanoma is associated with a significantly shorter time to brain metastasis, but not to other sites like lung or liver [2]. In a cohort of stage III melanoma patients, those with PTEN-negative tumors developed brain metastases more rapidly than those with intact PTEN, highlighting PTEN’s role in restraining central nervous system (CNS) dissemination [2]. Mechanistically, PTEN loss may enable melanoma cells to survive in the brain microenvironment by activating survival pathways and promoting immune evasion. Similarly, mutations in B2M, which disrupt MHC class I antigen presentation, are frequently observed in metastatic and immunotherapy-resistant melanomas; such mutations can facilitate immune escape, thereby allowing widespread metastatic spread [1]. Aprati et al. (2025) analyzed >7,000 melanoma cases and found B2M and PTEN mutations enriched in highly metastatic disease, supporting that these genetic lesions endow melanoma with greater metastatic potential overall [1]. Notably, their study distinguished a “brain metastasis” cluster of patients and a separate “highly-metastatic” cluster with multi-organ spread; PTEN mutations were more tied to the latter, suggesting PTEN loss contributes to generalized aggressiveness that often includes brain involvement [1]. This nuance aligns with the idea that while PTEN loss facilitates brain tropism, it tends to occur in tumors that are broadly metastatic rather than exclusively brain-specific.

In contrast, some mutations seem to impart a more organ-selective tropism. A striking finding is the association of GNAQ and GNA11 mutations with liver metastasis in melanoma [1]. These oncogenes are well-known drivers of uveal melanoma – a melanoma subtype that almost uniquely metastasizes to the liver. Cutaneous melanomas rarely harbor GNAQ/11 mutations, but Aprati et al. observed that when such mutations are present, the tumors showed disproportionate liver metastases [1]. They even validated this experimentally, demonstrating that introducing GNAQ/11 mutations in melanoma models increased liver colonization [1]. This finding suggests that the signaling networks activated by GNAQ/11 (e.g. through PLC/PKC and YAP pathways) condition melanoma cells to thrive in the hepatic microenvironment, mirroring the liver tropism of uveal melanoma. Apart from these, common driver mutations like BRAF or NRAS do not appear to dictate organ specificity of metastasis – for instance, BRAF^V600^-mutant and NRAS-mutant melanomas can metastasize to brain, lung, liver, etc., without a clear organ-preference difference [2]. It is the additional alterations (such as PTEN or B2M loss co-occurring with BRAF/NRAS) that more strongly influence the pattern of spread [2]. In summary, the genetic makeup of a melanoma – beyond the primary oncogenic driver – can bias its metastatic behavior: losing tumor suppressors like PTEN or immune-regulatory genes like B2M tends to unleash more widespread and CNS-invasive disease, whereas acquiring certain oncogenes (GNAQ/11) can redirect metastasis to specific organs like the liver.

Equally important is the epigenetic landscape of melanoma cells, which dynamically changes during metastasis and can favor colonization of particular organs. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling, regulate the expression of metastasis-related genes without altering the DNA sequence. As melanoma progresses from primary to metastatic stages, it undergoes profound epigenetic reprogramming. Marzese et al. (2014) performed an epigenome-wide analysis comparing patient-matched melanoma samples (including primary tumors, lymph node metastases, and brain metastases)[3]. They discovered a trend of global DNA hypomethylation (especially in gene-poor “open sea” regions of the genome) accompanying melanoma progression, along with increased methylation at certain CpG islands in promoter regions [3]. This pattern – loss of methylation globally but gain of methylation at specific sites – is a hallmark of advanced cancers and reflects epigenetic instability. Importantly, the study identified brain metastasis–specific epigenetic changes. Brain metastases (MBM) harbored unique partially methylated domains affecting genes involved in neural development [3]. Among the most significantly dysregulated was the HOX gene cluster, particularly HOXD9. HOXD9, a developmental transcription factor, showed higher promoter methylation in brain mets compared to earlier stages, yet within the brain lesions there existed regions of demethylation associated with its active expression [3]. In fact, low methylation (and hence high expression) of HOXD9 in metastatic cells was linked to open chromatin marks and could be induced with demethylating drugs [3]. Clinically, patients whose lymph node metastases already exhibited HOXD9 hypermethylation (silencing) had significantly worse outcomes, implying that failure to epigenetically activate certain developmental programs (like HOX genes) might hinder the ability to metastasize to or grow in certain organs [3]. This suggests that melanoma cells may need to unlock specific gene networks (via DNA demethylation) to adapt to the brain’s microenvironment. In other words, successful brain metastasis is partly enabled by epigenetic plasticity, allowing melanoma cells to adopt “brain-like” gene expression profiles that facilitate survival behind the blood–brain barrier and interaction with brain stromal factors. The HOXD9 finding exemplifies how an epigenetic state can govern organ tropism: methylation silencing in early disease vs. demethylation activation in brain metastasis underscores an epigenetic switch that correlates with neurotropic metastatic behavior [3].

Beyond DNA methylation, microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs are key epigenetic regulators of gene expression that influence metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRs) can act as metastasis suppressors or promoters by post-transcriptionally silencing target genes. In the context of melanoma organ tropism, specific miRNA expression patterns in primary tumors have been linked to the later development of metastases in particular organs. A clear example comes from the work of Hanniford et al. (2015), who identified a brain metastasis–predictive miRNA signature in primary cutaneous melanomas [4]. They found that a set of four microRNAs – miR-150-5p, miR-15b-5p, miR-16-5p, and miR-374b-3p – was significantly downregulated in primary tumors from patients who eventually developed brain metastases, compared to those who never relapsed or who metastasized only to extracranial sites [4]. This four-miRNA combination, when added to standard clinical staging, improved the accuracy of predicting brain metastasis risk [4]. Functionally, these miRNAs likely modulate pathways involved in immune surveillance and cellular migration. Notably, miR-150-5p stood out: it is normally expressed in lymphocytes, and the study observed that melanomas with low miR-150 tended to have fewer infiltrating T-cells [4]. Low miR-150 in the tumor correlated with reduced CD45^+ immune cell presence, suggesting an immune-evasion phenotype that may facilitate seeding in the brain (an immunologically protected niche) [4]. Thus, epigenetic silencing of certain miRNAs in the primary tumor can pre-condition melanoma cells for brain tropism, possibly by enabling escape from immune destruction and enhancing traits needed for brain colonization (like endothelial transmigration or survival signals). While this signature was specific to brain metastasis, other studies indicate that distinct miRNA profiles could underlie tropism to other organs as well. For instance, differentially expressed miRNAs have been implicated in melanoma progression to the lungs or liver in experimental models, though specific organ-tropic signatures in patients remain under investigation. The principle, however, is that epigenetic regulators like miRNAs orchestrate gene expression changes that either permit or constrain metastasis to certain environments.

In conclusion, the organ tropism of melanoma metastasis arises from an interplay between its genomic alterations and epigenetic state. Genetic features such as PTEN or B2M loss, and mutations in genes like GNAQ/GNA11, fundamentally alter the metastatic “skill set” of melanoma cells – affecting their growth, survival, and immune evasion in specific organs. Concurrently, epigenetic features – including DNA methylation patterns and microRNA-regulated gene expression – provide an additional layer of specificity by activating or silencing pathways that match the demands of the target organ’s microenvironment. A high mutational burden (TMB) in melanoma has even been linked to reduced metastatic spread, presumably due to immunogenicity [1], which underscores how genetic makeup can influence the extent of metastasis. Once disseminated, melanoma cells must dynamically reprogram their epigenome to colonize diverse tissues; failure to do so can limit metastasis, whereas successful reprogramming (e.g. demethylating a neural developmental gene for brain metastasis) can drive organ-specific outgrowth [3]. Understanding these genetic and epigenetic determinants of melanoma organ tropism is not only academically interesting but has practical implications: it could guide risk stratification (identifying patients at risk for, say, brain metastases via molecular profiling) and suggest targeted therapies (for example, PI3K pathway inhibitors for PTEN-null melanomas, or epigenetic drugs to reverse pro-metastatic methylation patterns). Ongoing research continues to map the complex “seed and soil” relationship in melanoma, but it is clear that the tumor’s own genome and epigenome play decisive roles in steering metastatic cells to their eventual destinations.Aprati, T.

Specific genetic drivers, such as alterations in the PI3K signaling pathway, have been linked to colonization of particular organs (e.g., the brain), while extensive epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and noncoding RNA expression, confer the necessary phenotypic plasticity for survival in a foreign niche. 

The process of melanoma metastasis to specific organs is not random but follows predictable patterns, such as ocular melanoma's strong predilection for the liver. This specificity is governed by the ability of a rare subpopulation of tumor cells to overcome a series of selective pressures or ""bottlenecks"" associated with the metastatic cascade. 
Genetic Features
While general mediators of metastasis (e.g., invasion capability, immune evasion) are necessary, specific genetic alterations enable passage through critical organ-specific barriers. 
Key Pathways: The PI3K signaling pathway has been specifically implicated in the organotropism of brain colonization.
Clonal Selection: Metastatic cells can undergo clonal evolution, acquiring time-dependent genetic mutations that confer properties necessary for proliferation and survival in distant sites.
Limited Organ-Specific Drivers: Despite extensive research, identifying specific genetic mutations solely responsible for site-specific metastasis has been challenging, suggesting that genetics work in concert with other mechanisms. Most genetic drivers found in primary tumors, such as BRAF V600E, are initiating events and do not, by themselves, guarantee organ-specific metastasis. 
Epigenetic Features
Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial for providing the high degree of phenotypic plasticity and adaptability that melanoma cells require to survive in diverse and challenging microenvironments. These changes do not alter the underlying DNA sequence but affect gene expression. 
Phenotype Switching: Melanoma cells can dynamically switch between different cellular states (phenotypes) in response to local microenvironmental signals, a process driven by epigenetic changes. This includes aspects of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which enhances migratory and invasive capacity.
Organ-Specific Reprogramming: The epigenome is subjected to modulation by signals from the microenvironment of the primary tumor and, critically, the end organ.
Brain Metastasis: Methylome analyses of patient-matched brain metastases show similarities among intracranial samples that are distinct from extracranial ones, indicating that the brain microenvironment imposes common epigenetic pressures.
Noncoding RNAs: Various noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), have been shown to be involved in melanoma progression and the determination of organ tropism. 
In summary, organotropism emerges from the coordinated interaction of tumor-intrinsic properties (shaped by both genetics and epigenetics) and crucial extrinsic factors within the specific organ microenvironment.

63,Melanoma,"What are the genetic and epigenetic features of early-stage primary melanoma to predict future disease progression, and determine the use of adjuvant therapy?",Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER:
Genetic and epigenetic features are critical for predicting disease progression and guiding adjuvant therapy in early-stage primary melanoma. Key genetic markers for progression include the sequential acquisition of mutations in genes like BRAF, NRAS, TERT, and CDKN2A. Specifically, TERT promoter mutations are early events, while CDKN2A inactivation occurs in invasive melanoma (PMID:26559571). Furthermore, a 31-gene expression profile (GEP) test can stratify early-stage patients into different metastatic risk groups (PMID:28851416). Epigenetically, a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), characterized by widespread hypermethylation, is a powerful predictor of worse survival, even when present in early-stage tumors (PMID:34843679).

For determining adjuvant therapy, genetic features are paramount. BRAF V600 mutations indicate eligibility for targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors (PMID:30675668, PMID:38295889), while KIT mutations suggest the use of KIT inhibitors (PMID:30675668). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) can also predict the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (PMID:34277420). Epigenetic features are emerging as crucial biomarkers for immunotherapy. DNA methylation profiles can classify tumors into subsets, with low-methylation tumors showing significantly longer relapse-free survival in response to adjuvant immune checkpoint blockade compared to hypermethylated (CIMP) tumors. This suggests that a patient's methylome can predict their benefit from immunotherapy and supports the development of methylome-targeting strategies to enhance treatment efficacy (PMID:40682094). Therefore, an integrated analysis of both genetic mutations and epigenetic profiles provides the most comprehensive framework for risk stratification and personalized treatment decisions in early-stage melanoma.

ANALYSIS:
### **1. Introduction: Defining Early-Stage Primary Melanoma**

Melanoma is a form of cancer that originates from melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin. While it most commonly affects the skin, it can, in rare instances, develop in other parts of the body such as the mouth, eyes, or intestines. Primary pulmonary melanoma is an exceptionally rare variant, constituting only 0.01% of all primary lung tumors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma). Early-stage primary melanoma refers to melanoma that is confined to its original site and has not yet metastasized, but even at this stage, it can be lethal, necessitating accurate methods for predicting its potential for progression.

### **2. Genetic Features of Early-Stage Melanoma for Predicting Progression**

Genetic analysis of early-stage melanoma has identified several features that can help predict the likelihood of disease advancement. These include specific mutational events, patterns of gene expression, and the accumulation of genetic alterations over time.

**2.1. Sequential Acquisition of Genetic Alterations**
Melanoma progression is characterized by a distinct succession of genetic changes. Studies have identified an intermediate category of melanocytic neoplasia that possesses more than one pathogenic genetic alteration.
*   **BRAF V600E mutations** are found exclusively in clearly benign lesions, marking an early initiation event (PMID:26559571).
*   **Intermediate lesions** show an enrichment for **NRAS mutations** and other driver mutations (PMID:26559571).
*   **TERT promoter mutations** are early markers of neoplastic progression, found in 77% of intermediate lesions and melanomas in situ (PMID:26559571).
*   The biallelic inactivation of **CDKN2A** is a hallmark of the transition to invasive melanoma, while mutations in **PTEN** and **TP53** are found only in more advanced primary tumors (PMID:26559571).
*   Significant copy-number alterations and genetic heterogeneity, with distinct subpopulations, become prevalent only as melanoma progresses to the invasive stage. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is implicated as a major factor in both initiating and driving this mutational accumulation (PMID:26559571).

**2.2. Prevalence of BRAF V600 Mutations**
The BRAF V600 mutation is a common driver in melanoma, and its prevalence varies by subtype and stage, offering predictive insights.
*   One study found BRAF V600 mutations in 41.8% of tested tumors, with higher rates in patients under 60 years old (PMID:25051202).
*   The mutation was present in 64.7% of superficial spreading melanomas and 50.0% of lentigo maligna melanomas but was less frequent in acral lentiginous melanomas (ALMs) (18.8%) and nodular melanomas (20.0%) (PMID:25051202).
*   Importantly, for ALMs, the BRAF V600 mutation rate was significantly higher in late-stage (III/IV) disease (36.4%) compared to early-stage (I/II) disease (9.5%), suggesting its role in progression for this subtype (PMID:25051202).

**2.3. Gene Expression Profiling (GEP)**
Beyond single mutations, the broader landscape of gene expression can be used to stratify patients.
*   A 31-gene expression profile (GEP) test has been developed and validated to classify cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients into two groups with significantly different risks of metastasis (PMID:28851416).
*   This GEP test complements existing clinicopathologic features, improving the identification of high-risk patients even at an early stage, as confirmed in real-world cohorts where recurrence-free survival (RFS) outcomes were consistent with previous analyses (PMID:28851416).

### **3. Epigenetic Features of Early-Stage Melanoma for Predicting Progression**

Epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, provide another layer of prognostic information that is independent of genetic mutations and traditional clinical factors.

**3.1. DNA Methylation Subclasses and the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP)**
Epigenetic profiling has identified distinct subclasses of melanoma with different clinical outcomes.
*   A study of 89 primary invasive cutaneous melanomas identified three whole-genome methylation subclasses: low methylation, intermediate methylation, and a hypermethylated subclass known as the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) (PMID:34843679).
*   Critically, CIMP melanomas can appear as early as tumor stage 1b and are associated with a significantly worse melanoma-specific survival rate (Hazard Ratio = 11.84) compared to low-methylation tumors, even after adjusting for factors like age, sex, and tumor stage (PMID:34843679).
*   CIMP is associated with older age at diagnosis (≥65 years), ulceration, higher tumor stage, and lower grades of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (PMID:34843679).
*   The genes found to be hypermethylated in CIMP melanomas include key players in tumor progression and immunity, such as **PTEN, VDR, PD-L1, and TET2**, as well as gene sets related to development, the extracellular matrix, and immunity (PMID:34843679). This indicates that CIMP is an early epigenetic marker of aggressive disease.

### **4. Mechanisms of Disease Progression**

Both genetic and epigenetic alterations drive melanoma progression through distinct but interconnected mechanisms, ranging from clonal expansion to immune evasion.

**4.1. Genetic Mechanisms of Progression**
The accumulation of genetic alterations propels melanoma from a localized lesion to an invasive, metastatic cancer.
*   In acral melanoma, the transition from in situ to invasive disease involves an early monoclonal seeding event, followed by clonal expansion and the diversification of subclones. An aggressive subtype is characterized by this subclonal diversification, an increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and spatial enrichment of APOE (PMID:38759655).
*   Melanoma progression generally starts with mutations activating the MAP kinase pathway (e.g., BRAF V600E), followed by the sequential acquisition of mutations in NRAS, TERT, CDKN2A, PTEN, and TP53. This step-wise increase in point mutations, driven by factors like UV radiation, leads to greater tumor heterogeneity as genetically distinct subpopulations emerge (PMID:26559571).
*   As melanomas become advanced and metastatic, they often grow in subcutaneous tissues rich in adipocytes, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment, such as the presence of fat cells, influences progression, though the specific mechanisms are still poorly understood (PMID:29903879).

**4.2. Epigenetic Mechanisms of Progression**
Epigenetic changes regulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, contributing to melanoma's high cellular plasticity and ability to evade the immune system.
*   Aberrant DNA methylation and histone modifications are well-established epigenetic mechanisms in melanoma that correlate with its cellular characteristics and clinicopathological features, offering potential targets for diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis (PMID:24895357).
*   The overexpression of the protein DSS1, linked to poor prognosis, is inversely correlated with the methylation status of its promoter, indicating that promoter hypomethylation is a frequent event that modulates gene expression in melanoma (PMID:27825810).
*   Epigenetic changes can also drive immune evasion. Aberrant glycosylation patterns in melanoma interact with lectins on immune cells, dismantling the anti-tumor defense (PMID:38742251). Epigenetic abnormalities within the tumor microenvironment can also cause dysfunction in TILs. For example, inactivating the epigenetic modifier Tet2 was shown to significantly enhance the antitumor activity of TILs, similar to the effect of immune checkpoint inhibition (PMID:33589517).
*   Cellular plasticity is influenced by the tumor microenvironment, which can alter the epigenetic state. For instance, geometric features at the periphery of melanoma aggregates are linked to reprogramming to a stem-cell-like state through histone marks H3K4Me2 and H3K9Ac (PMID:32620903).
*   Specific histone marks like elevated H3K27me3 and decreased E-cadherin are associated with a more mesenchymal phenotype and non-response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, suggesting these marks could predict patient responsiveness (PMID:28400597).
*   Furthermore, DNA methylation of the TNFRSF9 gene correlates with its mRNA expression, immune cell infiltration, and overall survival, making it a potential biomarker for predicting disease progression in patients receiving immunotherapy (PMID:32028068).

### **5. Role of Genetic and Epigenetic Features in Adjuvant Therapy Decisions**

The molecular profile of a melanoma is increasingly used to guide the selection of adjuvant therapies, which are treatments given after the primary tumor has been removed to reduce the risk of recurrence.

**5.1. Genetic Features Guiding Adjuvant Therapy**
Specific genetic mutations are direct targets for therapy and key factors in treatment decisions.
*   The presence of a **BRAF mutation** is a significant factor in directing the treatment of advanced melanoma (PMID:38295889). Patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma are candidates for the standard-of-care combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (PMID:30675668).
*   Similarly, patients whose tumors harbor a **KIT mutation** in exon 11 or 13 may be treated with KIT inhibitors (PMID:30675668).
*   The **Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB)** is clinically relevant as it may predict a patient's response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (PMID:34277420). The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) classified melanomas into four molecular subtypes based on mutations, each corresponding to different treatment pathways (PMID:34277420).
*   The distinct molecular landscape of mucosal melanoma, which has unique driver mutations, also influences therapeutic strategies (PMID:35511393).
*   Overall, identifying high-risk patients who will benefit from adjuvant therapy is crucial, and genetic features are essential prognostic markers for improving patient management (PMID:33925387). Integrating blood and tumor immune-related biomarkers can help generate a signature to maximize the prediction of immunotherapeutic benefits (PMID:40392969).

**5.2. Epigenetic Features Guiding Adjuvant Therapy**
DNA methylation profiles are emerging as powerful predictors of response to adjuvant immunotherapy.
*   A multi-omics analysis identified four tumor subsets based on DNA methylation levels: DEMethylated, LOW, INTermediate, and CIMP. Patients with LOW methylation tumors had longer survival and lower progression rates than those with CIMP tumors (PMID:40682094).
*   In a cohort of patients receiving adjuvant immune checkpoint blockade, those with pre-therapy tumors classified as DEM/LOW methylation had significantly longer relapse-free survival compared to those with INT/CIMP tumors (PMID:40682094).
*   These findings establish DNA methylation classes as having prognostic and therapeutic relevance, suggesting that a patient's methylation profile can predict their response to immunotherapy (PMID:40682094).
*   Furthermore, treating melanoma cell lines with a DNMT inhibitor (a demethylating agent) reprogrammed the cells toward a de-differentiated profile associated with the upregulation of immunotherapy response signatures. This supports the potential use of epigenetic drugs to sensitize tumors to immune-based treatments by targeting the methylome (PMID:40682094).

### **6. Methodologies for Studying Genetic and Epigenetic Features in Melanoma**

A variety of advanced methodologies are employed to uncover the complex molecular landscape of melanoma.
*   For different melanoma subtypes like uveal melanoma (UM) and conjunctival melanoma (CjM), molecular, genetic, and immunobiological mechanisms are reviewed. Genetic analysis in UM helps identify patients at high risk of metastasis, and changes in miRNA expression can serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers (PMID:37628989, PMID:31683701).
*   Large-scale data analysis using resources like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) allows for comparisons of mRNA expression and DNA methylation between melanomas of different thicknesses. This approach has identified hub genes (e.g., CD4, CTLA4, IFNG) and pathways related to the immune response that differ between thin and thick melanomas (PMID:40127249).
*   Animal models, such as zebrafish transgenesis, combined with studies of human tissues, are used to investigate mechanisms of tumor initiation. This has revealed, for example, that GABAergic signaling between keratinocytes and melanocytes can promote melanoma initiation by the BRAFV600E oncogene (PMID:37553760).
*   Gene editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 are used to establish knockout tumor cells in immunocompetent mouse models. These models allow researchers to study the impact of specific genes, such as ALDH2, on the tumor immune microenvironment and the function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and to test the synergistic efficacy of gene blockade with immune checkpoint inhibitors (PMID:38088186).","1.

Genetic and epigenetic features that predict progression in early-stage melanoma include BRAF mutations, tumor mutation burden, chromosomal instability, and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), though their clinical utility for guiding adjuvant therapy decisions remains limited. Currently, gene expression profiling (GEP) tests are not recommended by major guidelines to direct clinical decision-making, as they have not demonstrated added benefit beyond comprehensive clinicopathologic factors.

ANALYSIS:

Genetic Features

BRAF V600 mutations occur in approximately 50% of melanomas and are associated with sensitivity to BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations in the adjuvant setting for stage III disease with lymph node involvement.[1] However, BRAF testing is not recommended for stage I-II melanoma unless needed for clinical trial eligibility or to guide future adjuvant therapy in high-risk patients.[2]

Tumor mutation burden assessed by targeted next-generation sequencing correlates with immune checkpoint inhibitor response and may identify patients more likely to benefit from adjuvant immunotherapy, though its use remains investigational.[2] Chromosomal instability score (CIS) has emerged as an independent predictor of disease-free survival, with high CIS associated with significantly worse outcomes (median DFS 14.3 vs 49.7 months).[3]

Epigenetic Features

The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) represents a distinct epigenetic subclass present even in early-stage melanomas (stage IB and above).[4] CIMP melanomas demonstrate hypermethylation of genes critical for melanoma progression including PTEN, VDR, PD-L1, and TET2, and are associated with significantly worse melanoma-specific survival (HR 11.84) independent of traditional prognostic factors.[4] CIMP occurs more frequently in patients ≥65 years, lentigo maligna melanoma subtype, and tumors with ulceration.[4]

Gene Expression Profiling

Multiple GEP platforms have been developed, including the 31-GEP, 11-GEP (MelaGenix), and CP-GEP (combining clinicopathologic factors with 8-gene expression).[5-6] These tests stratify patients into risk categories that correlate with recurrence and survival outcomes. For example, CP-GEP identified stage I/IIA patients at high risk with 5-year relapse-free survival of 74% versus 89% in low-risk patients (HR 2.98).[7]

Current Guideline Recommendations

Despite commercial availability, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network explicitly does not recommend incorporating GEP tests into melanoma care.[2] The Society of Surgical Oncology consensus statement concludes that current evidence is insufficient to change clinical practice to incorporate GEP testing for adjuvant treatment decisions.[8] The American Academy of Dermatology discourages routine GEP for management decisions outside clinical trials.[9]

Key limitations include: (1) GEP has not demonstrated added benefit beyond comprehensive clinicopathologic variables in prospective validation studies; (2) high false-positive rates, particularly in stage IA disease; (3) no prospective trials have used GEP results to guide adjuvant therapy; and (4) patient eligibility for adjuvant treatments is based on AJCC pathologic staging, not GEP results.[2][8]

Circulating Tumor DNA

Postoperative ctDNA detection shows promise for risk stratification, with ctDNA-positive patients (12-16% of resected stage II-III melanoma) demonstrating increased recurrence risk.[5] Maximum variant allele frequency >1% in postsurgical ctDNA predicts worse disease-free survival (median 11.0 vs 49.7 months).[3]

Clinical Application

For determining adjuvant therapy eligibility, pathologic staging remains the standard, with pembrolizumab and nivolumab approved for stage IIB-IIC disease based on AJCC staging alone.[1-2] Adjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibitors are approved for stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E/K mutations and lymph node involvement.[1] Ongoing trials like NivoMela are prospectively evaluating whether GEP-guided selection of stage II patients for adjuvant nivolumab improves outcomes.[8]","1.

Key genetic markers include prognostic gene expression profiles: for example, a validated 31-gene expression signature in primary tumors identifies high-risk cases with significantly greater recurrence and mortality rates than indicated by conventional staging【1】. Likewise, certain somatic mutations portend aggressive behavior – notably, TERT promoter mutations are associated with higher recurrence rates and significantly worse survival outcomes【4】. Epigenetic biomarkers further refine risk assessment. A DNA methylation signature (based on a panel of CpG sites) has demonstrated superior prognostic accuracy for overall survival compared to traditional clinicopathologic factors【3】. Differential microRNA expression is also prognostic: integrating tumor miRNA profiles into risk models markedly improves the identification of stage I–II patients likely to relapse【2】. Collectively, these genetic and epigenetic features help predict which early-stage primary melanomas are prone to progression. In turn, such biomarkers inform adjuvant therapy decisions – guiding clinicians to recommend post-surgical systemic treatment (e.g. immune or targeted therapy) for patients with high-risk molecular profiles while sparing truly low-risk patients from unnecessary treatment【1】【2】【4】.

Accurate prognostication of early-stage melanoma is critical, as a subset of thin, localized melanomas will eventually metastasize despite initially favorable clinical features【1】. Traditional prognostic factors (tumor thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, etc.) are important but often insufficiently precise for predicting an individual patient’s outcome. Recent research has therefore focused on genetic and epigenetic characteristics of primary melanomas that may signal an elevated propensity for future progression. These biomarkers aim to identify high-risk patients who might benefit from adjuvant therapy after surgery and to reassure those with truly low-risk tumors. Below we discuss key categories of such markers with supporting evidence.

Genetic Expression Signatures: Gene expression profiling of primary melanoma tissue has yielded reproducible prognostic signatures. Notably, a 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test has been clinically validated to stratify early-stage melanomas by metastatic risk. In a multi-study meta-analysis comprising 1,479 patients, this RNA expression signature consistently identified patients at increased risk of recurrence and death independent of AJCC stage【1】. Patients classified as “high risk” by the 31-GEP (Class 2B) had markedly worse 5-year outcomes – for instance, only ~44% recurrence-free survival, compared to ~91% for “low risk” Class 1A cases【1】. The high-risk gene profile conferred about a 3-fold higher hazard of relapse and metastasis even among stage I–II patients【1】. Such data underscore that gene expression patterns in the primary tumor can reveal aggressiveness not apparent from histology alone. In fact, gene signatures often reflect the tumor’s biology (e.g. cell cycle, immune microenvironment), offering prognostic information beyond traditional factors. Garg et al., for example, identified a 121-gene “metastasis-associated” signature enriched in primary melanomas that eventually spread; this signature correlated with low immune-cell infiltration in the tumor and predicted significantly poorer 5-year survival in otherwise early-stage disease【1】. Overall, expression-based classifiers can complement or augment standard staging by reclassifying certain thin melanomas as high risk, prompting closer surveillance or additional therapy【1】.

Epigenetic Alterations – DNA Methylation: Aberrant DNA methylation is another hallmark of melanoma progression. Advancing melanomas often exhibit global DNA hypomethylation and region-specific hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, changes which can be harnessed as prognostic markers. Guo et al. analyzed genome-wide methylation in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) melanomas and derived a four-CpG methylation signature that stratified patients by outcome【3】. This methylation biomarker was significantly associated with overall survival and, notably, outperformed established clinical predictors in accuracy【3】. Patients with an unfavorable methylation profile had substantially shorter survival, whereas those with the protective methylation pattern had prolonged survival, independent of stage. Similarly, immunohistochemical studies of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) levels have shown that primary melanomas with low overall DNA methylation (“hypomethylation”) correlate with aggressive features (e.g. deeper Breslow depth, ulceration) and worse prognosis. In one recent analysis, patients whose tumors had low 5-mC content had significantly higher rates of recurrence and melanoma-specific mortality【3】. Multivariate modeling confirmed that global DNA methylation levels were an independent predictor of survival, suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation contributes to melanoma virulence【3】. These findings highlight DNA methylation status as a useful biomarker: either as specific gene methylation panels or as a global methylation index, it can help flag early tumors that are molecularly primed for metastasis.

Epigenetic Alterations – microRNA Profiles: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, and their dysregulation is implicated in melanoma progression. Dozens of miRNAs have been found to be differentially expressed between indolent and metastatic melanomas, and specific miRNA signatures have prognostic value. Wiggins et al. recently profiled miRNA expression in a large cohort of stage II–III melanomas and integrated these data with clinical factors【2】. They discovered that adding a tumor miRNA signature to a standard prognostic model significantly improved prediction of 5-year melanoma-specific survival for early-stage patients【2】. In stage II cases, for example, the area-under-the-curve (AUC) for predicting 5-year survival rose from 0.71 with clinical variables alone to 0.81 when miRNA expression was included【2】. Several miRNAs (e.g. members of the miR-200 and let-7 families, among others identified) were associated with outcome, indicating that miRNA dysregulation contributes to melanoma aggressiveness. The authors concluded that incorporating miRNA profiles can refine risk stratification and “potentially aid the selection of melanoma patients for adjuvant treatment”【2】. This prognostic role of miRNAs is supported by other studies as well – for instance, independent research identified a 5-miRNA signature (including miR-21 and miR-199a) that predicted melanoma survival, further underscoring the utility of non-coding RNA markers in early disease management. In summary, tumor epigenetic profiles – whether DNA methylation or miRNA expression – provide an additional layer of prognostic insight beyond the static genome.

Somatic Genetic Alterations: In addition to broad expression or epigenetic patterns, specific genetic mutations in primary melanoma can signal higher malignant potential. The clearest example is TERT promoter mutations. These mutations (commonly -124C>T or -146C>T in the telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter) are found in a significant subset of cutaneous melanomas and lead to upregulated telomerase expression. A comprehensive meta-analysis of >2,500 patients confirmed that TERT promoter mutations are associated with significantly poorer survival outcomes【4】. Pooled data showed that melanomas with TERT promoter mutations had a ~1.5-fold higher hazard of melanoma-specific mortality compared to TERT-wildtype, and similarly worse disease-free and distant metastasis-free survival trends【4】. Clinically, this implies that even an early-stage melanoma harboring a TERT promoter mutation should be viewed as higher risk; indeed, such tumors often coincide with other high-risk features (thickness, ulceration) and may merit more aggressive management. By contrast, the most frequent oncogenic mutations in melanoma (BRAF and NRAS) have not shown a consistent independent prognostic effect on early-stage disease progression – their main relevance lies in therapy selection if metastasis occurs. However, knowing the BRAF status is still useful at diagnosis, since a patient with high-risk melanoma that is BRAF-mutant could be eligible for targeted adjuvant therapy if upstaged (e.g. BRAF/MEK inhibitors in stage III). Other genetic factors, such as copy number alterations or tumor mutational burden, are being explored for prognostic value, but robust data in early-stage melanoma are still limited. Overall, TERT promoter status stands out as a genetic feature of the primary tumor that correlates with outcome and can complement histologic risk factors【4】.

Impact on Adjuvant Therapy Decisions: The ultimate goal of identifying high-risk molecular features in early melanoma is to guide post-surgical treatment and surveillance. Adjuvant systemic therapy – particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies – has historically been reserved for regionally advanced (stage III) melanoma. Now, evidence is emerging that even certain “early” high-risk melanomas benefit from adjuvant therapy: for instance, recent trials showed that adjuvant anti-PD-1 immunotherapy significantly improves recurrence-free survival in resected stage IIB/IIC patients, whose baseline relapse risk approaches that of stage III【2】. The challenge is to determine which stage I–II patients truly need such therapy, given the potential toxicity and cost. This is where genetic and epigenetic biomarkers are especially valuable. A patient with an ostensibly low-stage melanoma but who has a high-risk 31-gene expression score or unfavorable methylation/miRNA profile might be considered for adjuvant treatment or clinical trial enrollment, even if not classically indicated. Conversely, a patient with a thick melanoma but a biomarker profile indicative of low metastatic potential might be managed with observation alone, sparing them unnecessary intervention【2】. In a 2023 survey of melanoma specialists, the majority agreed that they would be receptive to using prognostic gene expression tests in trials to identify which stage IIB/C patients could safely forgo adjuvant immunotherapy and which lower-stage patients might benefit from it【2】. Although such biomarkers are not yet mandatory in guidelines, their integration into decision-making is growing. In practice, some centers are already incorporating results of the 31-GEP or similar assays when discussing adjuvant anti-PD1 therapy with stage II patients, especially if the risk-benefit of treatment is unclear. Over time, as these tools are refined, clinicians will be better equipped to personalize therapy intensity based on an individual tumor’s molecular risk signature.

In conclusion, early-stage primary melanomas can be molecularly profiled to predict their likelihood of progressing to advanced disease. Genetic signatures (like multi-gene expression profiles) and epigenetic markers (DNA methylation patterns, miRNA profiles) have shown strong associations with long-term outcomes in melanoma patients. These biomarkers, along with select gene mutations such as TERT promoter status, improve our ability to distinguish truly high-risk tumors from low-risk ones. By doing so, they inform the use of adjuvant therapies – identifying patients who stand to gain from early systemic treatment to prevent relapse, and sparing others the risks of overtreatment. This risk-adapted approach, grounded in genetic and epigenetic tumor features, represents a critical step toward more personalized melanoma management【1】【2】【4】. Ongoing research and clinical trials will further clarify how best to implement these biomarkers, but they already demonstrate clear potential to enhance prognostic accuracy and guide adjuvant therapy decisions in early-stage melanoma.","Greenhaw, B.

The primary prognostic factors for early-stage cutaneous melanoma (Stage I and II) have historically been clinicopathological features, notably Breslow tumor thickness and ulceration status. Patients with Stage I and low-risk Stage II melanoma are generally cured by surgical excision alone, and do not typically receive adjuvant systemic therapy due to potential toxicities. The challenge lies in identifying which of these early-stage patients, particularly those in Stage IIB/IIC who have high recurrence rates, are at sufficient risk of future disease progression (metastasis or recurrence) to warrant aggressive adjuvant treatment. Genetic and epigenetic features are emerging as critical tools for this risk stratification. 
Genetic Features (Gene Expression Profiling and Mutations)
Gene Expression Profiling (GEP) Panels: GEP tests are widely used to stratify patients into low-risk or high-risk categories for recurrence or metastasis. These panels, such as the 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP), CP-GEP (Merlin), and MelaGenix, analyze gene expression from the primary tumor to provide a prognostic score.
Prognosis and Adjuvant Therapy Guidance: High-risk GEP results in sentinel lymph node (SLN)-negative patients may suggest a need for closer surveillance or consideration for adjuvant therapy, which can include immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) or targeted therapies (BRAF/MEK inhibitors). For T1b melanomas (0.8-1.0 mm thickness), GEP testing has shown high negative predictive value, potentially reducing the rate of SLNB procedures by identifying low-risk patients who can safely avoid the procedure and its associated morbidities.
Relevant Pathways and Genes: GEP panels often analyze genes involved in immune evasion, lymphangiogenesis, and cell cycle regulation, including markers related to CDKN2A, BRAF, and NRAS mutations.
BRAF and NRAS Mutations: The mutational status of driver genes, particularly in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (BRAF and NRAS), affects treatment responses. BRAF mutations (e.g., V600E) are predictive markers for response to BRAF/MEK inhibitor targeted therapies, a key option for adjuvant treatment in appropriate high-risk cases. 
Epigenetic Features
Epigenetic modifications, which alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence, are being explored as crucial biomarkers. 
DNA Methylation: Aberrant DNA hypermethylation in the promoter regions of tumor-related genes (TRGs) can silence their function and promote tumor progression. These patterns have been linked to prognosis in adult cutaneous melanoma.
PRAME Expression: The expression of the PRAME gene (Preferentially Expressed Antigen of Melanoma), often assessed via GEP or immunohistochemistry, is a significant prognostic marker. Elevated PRAME expression is associated with poorer overall survival and a higher likelihood of SLN positivity, indicating increased risk of progression.
MicroRNA (miRNA) Expression: Dysregulated miRNA expression is implicated in melanoma progression and metastasis by affecting cell adhesion, proliferation, and apoptosis. Circulating cell-free DNA and RNA, including miRNAs, show promise as prognostic markers, with baseline levels correlating with outcomes in advanced stages. 
In summary, a combination of genetic (especially GEP signatures and BRAF status) and epigenetic (e.g., PRAME expression, methylation patterns) features in the primary tumor helps refine risk stratification for early-stage melanoma patients beyond traditional staging. These features are vital in identifying the subset of high-risk patients for whom the substantial benefits of adjuvant systemic therapies may outweigh the significant toxicities.

64,TME,Which tumor-intrinsic genes are essential for cancer cells to be effectively recognized and killed by CD8⁺ T-cell–based immunotherapies?,Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER: For cancer cells to be effectively recognized and killed by CD8+ T-cell-based immunotherapies, a functional tumor-intrinsic Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I antigen presentation pathway is essential. Key genes in this pathway include those encoding MHC-I heavy chains (HLA-A, B, C), β2-microglobulin (B2M), and components of the antigen processing machinery like TAP1, TAP2, Tapasin, ERAP1, and immunoproteasome subunits. The expression of these genes is critically regulated by the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling pathway, which relies on genes such as IFNGR1, JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, and IRF1. Loss-of-function mutations or downregulation of any of these components can lead to immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy.

Conversely, the effective recognition and killing of cancer cells requires the *absence or inhibition* of certain tumor-intrinsic genes that promote immune evasion. These include:
- **Immune checkpoint ligands:** PD-L1 (CD274), whose expression is driven by oncogenes like MYC and pathways involving NPM1.
- **Metabolic regulators:** SLC16A3, which creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment through lactic acid efflux.
- **Inhibitors of innate immune sensing:** BANF1, which antagonizes the cGAS-STING pathway, and Caspase-9, which suppresses IFN-β secretion.
- **Epigenetic silencers:** SMYD3, which represses the expression of immune-related genes.
- **Pro-survival and resistance factors:** SIK3 and CAMK1D, which protect tumor cells from T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

Finally, the presence and activity of certain tumor-intrinsic genes can enhance CD8+ T-cell responses. These include genes in the cGAS-STING pathway, which promote an inflammatory tumor microenvironment, as well as specific genes like RGS1, LATS1/2, and TET2 that positively regulate IFN-γ signaling and antigen presentation, and chemokines such as CXCL14 that recruit CD8+ T-cells.

ANALYSIS:
### **Investigation Report: Tumor-Intrinsic Genetic Determinants of CD8+ T-Cell-Mediated Cancer Immunity**

**1.0 Introduction: Defining the Scope of the Investigation**

Immunotherapies, particularly those leveraging the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T-cells, have transformed cancer treatment. However, resistance remains a significant clinical challenge. This report investigates the tumor-intrinsic genes that are essential for cancer cells to be recognized and eliminated by CD8+ T-cell-based therapies. The investigation focuses on genes within the cancer cells that either facilitate or impede key stages of the anti-tumor immune response, including antigen presentation, immune cell recruitment, and evasion from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) attack.

Several studies highlight the complex interplay between tumor cell genetics and immune response. For instance, high expression of glycolysis-related genes, such as the lactate transporter SLC16A3 (MCT4), correlates with reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration, suggesting metabolic pathways can create an immunosuppressive microenvironment (PMID:38522774). Conversely, genes like RGS1 can enhance immunogenicity by activating IFN-γ signaling pathways, leading to increased expression of MHC class I (MHCI) and the T-cell recruiting chemokine CXCL9 (PMID:38264343). Other genes, such as BANF1, act as negative regulators of innate immune sensing by opposing the cGAS-STING pathway; deficiency of BANF1 in tumor cells enhances anti-tumor immunity and response to immunotherapy (PMID:37620043). Similarly, SMYD3 depletion leads to the upregulation of antigen presentation machinery and an influx of CD8+ T-cells (PMID:37463106). Tumor cells can also evolve direct resistance mechanisms; for example, SIK3 protects cancer cells from T-cell attack by promoting the TNF-NF-κB pro-survival pathway (PMID:35606086), while CAMK1D inhibits CTL-induced caspase activation (PMID:32665263). The cGAS-STING pathway is a central hub for inducing anti-tumor immunity, and its activation within tumor cells can trigger immunogenic cell death and improve immunotherapy outcomes (PMID:38056894; PMID:32169869). Furthermore, chemokines like CXCL14, when secreted by tumor cells, can directly recruit CD8+ T-cells and prolong survival (PMID:35511927). Tumor-intrinsic factors can also dictate the overall immune landscape, distinguishing between ""slow progressor"" melanomas with no T-cell activation and ""aggressive"" melanomas infiltrated by exhausted T-cells, a process independent of the adaptive immune system itself (PMID:20406967). Understanding these genetic determinants is crucial for overcoming immunotherapy resistance.

**2.0 Foundational Concepts in Cancer Immunology**

**2.1 Defining Tumor-Intrinsic Genes**
Tumor-intrinsic genes are genes inherent to the cancer cells themselves. These genes dictate cellular characteristics, including the ability to form tumors (tumorigenicity), self-renew, differentiate, and metastasize. Therapies targeted at specific products of these genes within cancer stem cells (CSCs)—a subpopulation of cancer cells with stem-like properties—are considered a promising strategy for improving patient outcomes, especially in metastatic disease (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_stem_cell).

**2.2 The Role of CD8+ T-Cells in Antitumor Immunity**
CD8+ T-cells, also known as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), are a critical component of the adaptive immune system responsible for eliminating pathological cells (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell). They play a significant role in cancer immunosurveillance by recognizing and killing neoplastic cells (PMID:29441071). Effective activation and effector function of CD8+ T-cells are crucial for clearing infections and mounting an effective anti-tumor response (PMID:35359994).

**2.3 Mechanism of CD8+ T-Cell-Based Immunotherapies**
Immunotherapy encompasses strategies that utilize the patient's own immune system to fight disease. In oncology, this often involves therapies designed to enhance or restore the immune system's ability to recognize and destroy malignant cells while sparing healthy tissue (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy).

**3.0 Core Mechanisms of CD8+ T-Cell Recognition and Tumor Evasion**

For CD8+ T-cells to effectively kill cancer cells, a series of molecular events must occur, beginning with the presentation of tumor antigens. Tumor-intrinsic gene expression profoundly influences this process, either promoting immune recognition or facilitating immune escape.

**3.1 The MHC Class I Antigen Presentation Pathway: The Gateway to T-Cell Recognition**
The cornerstone of CD8+ T-cell recognition is the MHC class I (MHC-I) antigen presentation pathway. This pathway allows CD8+ T-cells to survey the proteins being synthesized inside a cell and identify those that are abnormal, such as mutated proteins (neoantigens) in cancer cells (PMID:33767702; PMID:37130455).

*   **Mechanism of Antigen Presentation:** Cellular proteins are degraded into peptides by the proteasome. These peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing (TAP), a heterodimer of TAP1 and TAP2 (PMID:34973498; PMID:33767702). Inside the ER, peptides are loaded onto nascent MHC-I molecules, a process facilitated by the peptide-loading complex. The stable peptide-MHC-I complexes are then transported to the cell surface for presentation to CD8+ T-cells (PMID:33767702; PMID:38067336). This enables T-cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize specific cognate antigens, mediating the control of neoplasias (PMID:31398327). The recognition of these peptide-MHC-I complexes by CD8+ T-cells is a prerequisite for initiating a cytotoxic response (PMID:33271119; PMID:12196292). Even in gastrointestinal cancers, tumor-reactive CD8+ T-cells recognizing specific antigens presented on autologous HLA molecules can be found within tumor infiltrates (PMID:24218514).

*   **Immune Evasion via Loss of Antigen Presentation:** Because the MHC-I antigen presentation machinery (APM) is not essential for cancer cell survival, its inactivation is a common mechanism of immune evasion (PMID:33767702; PMID:37130455). Cancers can evolve to lose components of the APM, rendering them ""invisible"" to CD8+ T-cells. This loss is a frequent cause of both primary and acquired resistance to immunotherapies like checkpoint blockade (PMID:33767702; PMID:31570880). The loss of MHC-I expression is frequently observed in many cancer types, including NSCLC, breast, prostate, and melanoma, and is often associated with a worse clinical prognosis and resistance to immunotherapy (PMID:33767702).

*   **Mechanisms of APM Downregulation:** Tumors employ numerous strategies to disable the antigen presentation pathway:
    *   **Genetic Alterations:** Homozygous deletions or inactivating mutations in genes encoding MHC-I heavy chains, β2-microglobulin (B2M), TAP1/2, or other APM components are found in resistant tumors (PMID:33767702; PMID:27433843).
    *   **Transcriptional Silencing:** Expression of APM genes can be lost through epigenetic modifications like DNA hypermethylation or repressive histone marks (e.g., H3K27me3), or through the loss of key transcription factors such as NLRC5, IRF1, and IRF2 (PMID:33767702). Mouse models have shown that deficits in antigen presentation machinery contribute to immunotherapy resistance (PMID:38213329).
    *   **Post-Transcriptional and Post-Translational Regulation:** MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can target APM component mRNAs for degradation. Additionally, oncogenic signaling pathways (e.g., MAPK, HER2/neu, MYC) can downregulate MHC-I expression (PMID:33767702).

*   **TEIPPs as a Consequence of APM Defects:** Interestingly, tumors with deficient antigen processing (e.g., TAP-deficient) can present a novel class of self-antigens known as T-cell epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing (TEIPPs). These neoantigens are unmasked during tumor immune evasion and can be targeted by a distinct repertoire of CD8+ T-cells, offering a potential therapeutic avenue for tumors that have escaped conventional immune recognition (PMID:26784543).

**3.2 The IFN-γ Signaling Pathway: A Master Regulator of Tumor Immunogenicity**
The interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling pathway is a critical link between the adaptive immune response and tumor cell biology. IFN-γ, produced primarily by activated T-cells and NK cells, directly acts on tumor cells to modulate the expression of hundreds of genes, known as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (PMID:37275859).

*   **IFN-γ and Antigen Presentation:** A primary function of IFN-γ signaling is the transcriptional upregulation of the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway. The IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR) activates the JAK1/JAK2 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate STAT1. Phosphorylated STAT1 translocates to the nucleus and drives the expression of IRF1, a key transcription factor that initiates the expression of multiple APM genes, including MHC-I, TAP, and proteasome subunits (PMID:19811323; PMID:33767702). This process enhances the antigenicity of tumor cells, making them better targets for CD8+ T-cells (PMID:14525967). Studies have demonstrated that IFN-γ upregulates not only PD-L1 but also a suite of genes related to antigen processing and presentation, including TAP1/TAP2 and proteasome components (PMID:28494868).

*   **IFN-γ and Adaptive Immune Resistance:** Paradoxically, IFN-γ also drives adaptive immune resistance. The same JAK/STAT/IRF1 signaling axis that upregulates MHC-I also drives the expression of the immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1 (PMID:28494868; PMID:26155422). Upon recognition by T-cells, tumors upregulate PD-L1 to engage the PD-1 receptor on T-cells, thereby suppressing the anti-tumor immune response (PMID:35062949). The ability of tumors to respond to IFN-γ is therefore a double-edged sword, and the balance between increased antigenicity and immunosuppression is critical.

*   **Immune Evasion via Defects in IFN-γ Signaling:** Resistance to immunotherapy is frequently associated with defects in the tumor-intrinsic IFN-γ pathway (PMID:31570880). Loss-of-function mutations in key pathway components, such as *JAK1*, *JAK2*, *STAT1*, or *IFNGR1/2*, render tumor cells unresponsive to IFN-γ. This prevents the upregulation of APM components, leading to poor T-cell recognition and primary or acquired resistance to checkpoint blockade (PMID:27433843; PMID:27903500; PMID:33767702; PMID:9001223; PMID:8232552; PMID:7514165). This is supported by findings in various cancers where acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy is linked to mutations in *JAK1*, *JAK2*, and *B2M* (PMID:27433843), and where acquired resistance in NSCLC is associated with an altered IFN response (PMID:38215748). The presence of an intact IFN-γ response signature in baseline tumor samples is a strong predictor of clinical benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy across multiple cancer types (PMID:28650338). While tumors with IFN signaling defects are resistant to checkpoint blockade, they may retain sensitivity to adoptive cell therapy (PMID:33055240).

**4.0 Specific Tumor-Intrinsic Genes Modulating CD8+ T-Cell Responses**

Beyond the core APM and IFN-γ pathways, numerous other tumor-intrinsic genes have been identified as essential modulators of CD8+ T-cell recognition and killing. These can be broadly categorized as genes that promote immune evasion or genes that enhance immune recognition.

**4.1 Genes Promoting Immune Evasion and Immunotherapy Resistance**

These genes, when active or overexpressed in tumor cells, create an immunosuppressive state or directly protect the tumor from cytotoxic attack. Their inhibition is therefore essential for effective immunotherapy.

*   **PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1):** As the primary ligand for the PD-1 inhibitory receptor on T-cells, PD-L1 is a central mediator of immune evasion. Its expression can be driven by IFN-γ signaling (adaptive resistance) or by tumor-intrinsic oncogenic pathways (intrinsic resistance) (PMID:29562194; PMID:28494868).
    *   **Transcriptional Regulation:** The oncogene *MYC* directly binds the *PD-L1* promoter to drive its expression (PMID:26966191). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), Nucleophosmin (NPM1) acts as a transcriptional activator of *PD-L1*, while PARP1 suppresses this activity by interacting with NPM1. Consequently, PARP inhibitors can increase PD-L1 expression, providing a rationale for combination therapy with PD-L1 blockade (PMID:32245950).
    *   **Post-Translational Regulation:** The stability of the PD-L1 protein is tightly regulated. N-glycosylation of PD-L1 prevents its interaction with GSK3β, which would otherwise phosphorylate it and mark it for proteasomal degradation via the E3 ligase β-TrCP. EGFR signaling stabilizes PD-L1 by inactivating GSK3β (PMID:27572267). Separately, the palmitoyltransferase DHHC3 has been shown to palmitoylate PD-L1, which stabilizes the protein by blocking its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (PMID:30952982).
    *   **Genetic Regulation:** DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can upregulate PD-L1 expression in an ATM/ATR/Chk1-dependent manner, a process requiring STAT1/3 and IRF1 activation. Deficiencies in DSB repair genes like *BRCA2* or *Ku70/80* can further enhance this upregulation (PMID:29170499).

*   **Genes Suppressing Innate Immune Sensing:**
    *   **BANF1:** This gene functions as a natural opponent of the cGAS-STING pathway. High BANF1 expression in tumors is associated with poor survival and reduced immune cell infiltration. Conversely, BANF1 deficiency in tumor cells activates the cGAS-STING pathway, leading to an immune-activating microenvironment with increased CD8+ T-cells and enhanced response to anti-PD-1 therapy (PMID:37620043).
    *   **Caspase-9:** While Hsp90 inhibition can induce immunogenic cell death and IFN-β secretion via the mitochondrial DNA/cGAS/STING pathway, it also activates Caspase-9, which suppresses this intrinsic DNA sensing. Genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of Caspase-9 in combination with Hsp90 inhibition significantly boosts IFN-β release and anti-tumor effects (PMID:38056894).

*   **Genes Mediating Metabolic Immunosuppression:**
    *   **SLC16A3 (MCT4):** This transporter mediates the efflux of lactic acid from highly glycolytic tumor cells. High expression of glycolysis-related genes, including *SLC16A3*, is correlated with reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration. Lactic acid contributes to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and inhibition of Slc16a3 is being investigated as a strategy to improve immunotherapy effects (PMID:38522774).

*   **Genes Protecting from T-Cell Cytotoxicity:**
    *   **SIK3 (Salt-Inducible Kinase 3):** Inhibition of SIK3 in tumor cells dramatically increases their susceptibility to T-cell-mediated killing. SIK3 promotes tumor cell survival by enhancing TNF-NF-κB signaling and inhibiting TNF-induced activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 (PMID:35606086).
    *   **CAMK1D (Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase 1D):** This kinase is activated in tumor cells following Fas-receptor stimulation by CTLs. Activated CAMK1D then phosphorylates and inhibits caspases-3, -6, and -7, thereby mediating tumor-intrinsic resistance to CTL-induced apoptosis (PMID:32665263).

*   **Epigenetic and Transcriptional Repressors:**
    *   **SMYD3:** This histone methyltransferase maintains the repression of immune-related genes. SMYD3 depletion in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells leads to upregulation of Type I IFN response genes and antigen presentation machinery. It achieves this by regulating the transcription of UHRF1, which recruits the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 to silence key immune gene promoters (PMID:37463106).
    *   **CD58:** Loss of the cell adhesion molecule CD58 was identified as a mechanism of immune evasion in melanoma. Its loss does not compromise MHC expression, suggesting it acts orthogonally to the antigen presentation pathway to confer resistance to T-cell killing (PMID:33649592).

**4.2 Genes Promoting Immune Recognition and Immunotherapy Sensitivity**

The expression and function of these genes within tumor cells are critical for mounting an effective anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell response.

*   **Genes in the IFN-γ and Antigen Presentation Pathways:**
    *   **RGS1 (Regulator of G Protein Signaling 1):** High expression of RGS1 in cancer cells promotes anti-tumor immunity. It enhances the binding of the transcription factor ATF3 to the *IFNGR1* promoter, activating STAT1 and subsequent expression of IFN-γ-inducible genes like *CXCL9* and *MHC-I*, thereby increasing CD8+ T-cell recruitment and recognition (PMID:38264343).
    *   **LATS1/2:** These kinases, independent of the Hippo-YAP pathway, directly interact with and phosphorylate STAT1 at Ser727. This promotes STAT1 nuclear accumulation and enhances the transcriptional activation of *IRF1/NLRC5* and downstream *MHC-I* genes in response to IFN-γ signaling. Loss of LATS1/2 is associated with MHC-I downregulation and resistance to immune cell killing (PMID:38383447).
    *   **PTPN2:** Deletion of this protein tyrosine phosphatase in tumor cells enhances IFN-γ-mediated effects on antigen presentation and growth suppression, thereby increasing the efficacy of immunotherapy (PMID:28723893).
    *   **TET2:** This DNA dioxygenase promotes the expression of antigen presentation machinery genes within tumor cells. This effect is enhanced by its cofactor, vitamin C. Tumor-associated TET2 activity is required for T-cell-derived IFN-γ signaling within the tumor microenvironment (PMID:39388288).

*   **Genes Promoting T-Cell Recruitment and Inflammation:**
    *   **cGAS-STING Pathway:** Activation of the tumor-intrinsic cGAS-STING pathway is a potent mechanism for initiating anti-tumor immunity. Cytosolic DNA fragments activate cGAS to produce cGAMP, which activates STING, leading to the production of Type I interferons. This creates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, promotes immunogenic cell death, and enhances CD8+ T-cell responses (PMID:37620043; PMID:38056894). Direct activation of this pathway in neuroblastoma tumors using STING-activating nanoparticles (STING-NPs) induced immunogenic cell death and increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration (PMID:32169869).
    *   **CXCL14:** Secretion of this chemokine by tumor cells, as observed in MAPK-activated pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA), directly promotes the chemotaxis and recruitment of activated CD8+ T-cells into the tumor, prolonging survival in a cytotoxic T-cell-dependent manner (PMID:35511927).

**5.0 Conclusion: A Multi-faceted Genetic Landscape Dictates Immunotherapy Success**

The effective recognition and killing of cancer cells by CD8+ T-cell-based immunotherapies is not determined by a single gene but by the complex interplay of multiple tumor-intrinsic genetic and epigenetic pathways. The integrity of the MHC class I antigen presentation and IFN-γ signaling pathways stands as the foundational requirement for T-cell recognition. Genes within these pathways, including *HLA*s, *B2M*, *TAP1/2*, *JAK1/2*, and *STAT1*, are therefore essential positive determinants of immunotherapy response.

Equally critical is the functional status of pathways that can override or suppress this core machinery. Tumor-intrinsic genes that promote immune evasion, such as the checkpoint ligand *PD-L1*, metabolic disruptor *SLC16A3*, innate immunity suppressor *BANF1*, and cell survival factors *SIK3* and *CAMK1D*, represent key therapeutic targets. Their inhibition is essential to disarm the tumor's defenses.

Conversely, enhancing the activity of pro-inflammatory pathways provides a promising avenue for improving therapeutic outcomes. Activating the cGAS-STING pathway or leveraging genes like *RGS1* and *LATS1/2* that positively regulate IFN-γ signaling can convert an immunologically ""cold"" tumor into a ""hot"" one that is susceptible to T-cell attack. This comprehensive genetic landscape underscores the need for personalized medicine approaches that can identify the specific immune escape mechanisms active in a patient's tumor and select therapies designed to counteract them, thereby restoring the efficacy of CD8+ T-cell-mediated tumor destruction.","REFERENCE:

The antigen presentation machinery is fundamental, with genes encoding HLA class I components (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C), β2-microglobulin (B2M), and the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP1/TAP2) being essential for presenting tumor antigens to CD8⁺ T cells.[2-3] Loss-of-function mutations in these genes impair T-cell recognition and correlate with resistance to immunotherapy.[2-3] Additional antigen processing machinery components include the immunoproteasome subunits (LMP2, LMP7), ER chaperones (tapasin, calreticulin, ERp57), and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases (ERAP).[3]

Interferon-γ pathway genes are critical for immunotherapy efficacy. Key components include JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, and IRF1, which mediate interferon-γ responses and upregulate both antigen presentation machinery and immunostimulatory molecules like PD-L1 and CXCL10.[1-2][4] APLNR (apelin receptor) modulates interferon-γ signaling through JAK1 interaction, and its loss reduces immunotherapy efficacy.[2] Negative regulators of this pathway—including PTPN2, SOCS1, and ADAR1—when deleted, enhance cancer cell sensitivity to CD8⁺ T-cell killing.[1]

TNF signaling pathway genes emerged as dominant mediators of immune evasion in multiple screens.[1][5] Components of this pathway are required for cancer cells to respond to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity from CD8⁺ T cells and NK cells.[5] The autophagy pathway also plays a conserved role in resisting cytokine-induced cytotoxicity from both interferon-γ and TNF.[1]

Additional essential genes include CXCL10, which recruits CD8⁺ T cells expressing CXCR3 to the tumor microenvironment, and[4] cGAS, which produces cGAMP that transfers to dendritic cells and macrophages, promoting type I interferon production and CD8⁺ T-cell infiltration.[6] The metabolic gene FITM2 is required for maintaining cell fitness after interferon-γ exposure, while[1] BIRC2 limits antigen presentation by suppressing IRF1 activity.[7]

Would you like me to summarize the latest clinical evidence on how mutations or deficiencies in these tumor-intrinsic genes—particularly those in antigen presentation and interferon-γ pathways—impact patient responses and resistance to CD8⁺ T-cell–based immunotherapies in real-world cancer cohorts?

In particular, expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules – consisting of an HLA heavy chain and β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin – and intact antigen-processing machinery (e.g. TAP transporters) is essential for presenting tumor antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes[1]. Likewise, an intact IFN‑γ signaling pathway in the tumor (including the IFN‑γ receptor and downstream Janus kinases JAK1/JAK2) is crucial for upregulating antigen presentation and sensitizing tumor cells to T-cell attack [2]. Loss-of-function mutations in antigen presentation genes (such as B2M, encoding β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin) or IFN‑γ pathway genes (such as JAK1 or JAK2) abrogate tumor antigen display or IFN responsiveness, allowing cancer cells to escape recognition and killing by CD8⁺ T cells [2]. Genome-wide CRISPR screens have confirmed that genes mediating antigen presentation and IFN‑γ response are the core tumor-intrinsic requirements for CD8⁺ T cell effector function, and have identified additional essential genes like APLNR (encoding the apelin receptor) – a modulator of IFN‑γ signaling – whose loss impairs T-cell–mediated tumor cell killing [3]. Furthermore, tumor apoptotic pathways must remain intact for effective T cell cytotoxicity: for example, expression of the death receptor Fas (CD95) on tumor cells (and its downstream effector caspase-8) is needed for FasL⁺ CD8⁺ T cells to trigger apoptosis, such that tumors lacking Fas can resist CD8⁺ T-cell immunotherapies [4].

CD8⁺ T-cell–based immunotherapies (such as checkpoint inhibitors or adoptive T-cell transfers) rely on cancer cells presenting antigenic peptides on MHC-I molecules for T-cell recognition[1]. The MHC-I complex is composed of a polymorphic heavy chain (HLA-A, -B, or -C in humans) and an invariant light chain, β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (B2M). These components, along with antigen-processing machinery, are tumor-intrinsic genes that are absolutely required for a tumor cell to be recognized by CD8⁺ T cells. If a tumor cell loses expression of MHC-I heavy chains or B2M, it can no longer stably display antigen peptides on its surface, rendering it “invisible” to CD8⁺ T-cell receptors [1] [2]. For example, B2M is a “crucial factor required for the assembly of all HLA class I complexes and for the stable presentation of antigens” on tumor cells[1]. Clinically, loss-of-function mutations in B2M are a well-documented immune evasion mechanism: tumors with B2M mutations lack surface MHC-I and have been observed in patients who relapse on or resist PD-1 checkpoint blockade [2]. In one study of melanoma patients, an acquired truncating mutation in B2M led to complete loss of MHC-I on the tumor, coinciding with escape from an initial T-cell–mediated regression [2]. Consistently, restoring or preserving antigen presentation genes (HLA heavy chains, B2M, and antigen-processing components like TAP1/TAP2 and tapasin) is necessary for effective CD8⁺ T cell immunosurveillance. Tumors that inactivate these genes cannot present tumor antigens and therefore evade cytotoxic T-cell recognition
[1][2].

Another category of tumor-intrinsic genes indispensable for CD8⁺ T-cell–mediated killing is the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling pathway. When a CD8⁺ T cell recognizes a target cell, it not only releases perforin/granzymes but also secretes IFN-γ, a cytokine that induces antiproliferative and immunostimulatory effects in the tumor cell. Tumor cells must be able to respond to IFN-γ, which requires functional IFN-γ receptors (IFNGR1/2) and downstream signaling mediators like JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1. IFN-γ signaling in tumor cells upregulates MHC-I antigen presentation, boosts immunoproteasome activity, and can directly inhibit tumor cell division. Accordingly, loss-of-function mutations in IFNGR1, IFNGR2, JAK1, or JAK2 in the cancer cell undermine this pathway and are known to cause resistance to T-cell-based immunotherapies
[1][2]. For instance, a landmark study of melanoma patients who developed resistance to anti–PD-1 therapy found that two patients’ tumors had acquired truncating mutations in JAK1 or JAK2, which made the cancer cells completely unresponsive to IFN-γ (incapable of upregulating MHC-I or executing IFN-induced growth arrest) [2]. These JAK1/2-deficient tumors no longer succumbed to CD8⁺ T cell attack despite the presence of tumor-specific T cells [2]. Similarly, analyses of larger patient cohorts have identified defects in IFN-γ pathway genes as recurrent features of non-responding tumors. Sade-Feldman et al. reported that deletions or loss-of-heterozygosity in IFNGR1 (the IFN-γ receptor α chain) were enriched in melanoma patients who failed to respond to anti–PD-1 therapy[1]. These findings underscore that intact IFN-γ receptor signaling in tumor cells is essential for immunotherapy success. In summary, tumor-intrinsic antigen presentation and IFN-γ response genes form the backbone that enables CD8⁺ T cells to recognize and destroy cancer cells; genetic lesions in these pathways are common mechanisms of immune evasion and therapy resistance
[1][2].

Beyond these well-known requirements, recent functional genomics approaches have uncovered additional tumor-intrinsic genes that are critical for effective T-cell mediated immunotherapy. Patel et al. performed a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in human tumor cells co-cultured with cytotoxic T cells, which pinpointed a set of “essential genes” in tumor cells whose loss conferred resistance to T cell killing [3]. Strikingly, the top hits from this screen clustered in the very same pathways discussed above – antigen presentation (e.g. HLA class I, B2M) and IFN-γ signaling – validating their central importance [3]. This unbiased screen also identified novel tumor-intrinsic genes not previously linked to immunity. One prominent example was APLNR, which encodes the apelin receptor[3]. Although APLNR is not a classical immune gene, knockouts of APLNR in tumor cells impaired CD8⁺ T cell effector function, and multiple immunotherapy-refractory human tumors were found to harbor loss-of-function mutations in APLNR[3]. Mechanistic follow-up revealed that APLNR normally interacts with JAK1 and helps modulate the IFN-γ signaling cascade in tumor cells[3]. Loss of APLNR function made tumor cells less responsive to IFN-γ and thereby resistant to T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity[3]. In mouse models, tumors lacking APLNR showed reduced sensitivity to both adoptive T-cell transfer therapy and checkpoint blockade, further confirming APLNR as a tumor-intrinsic gene necessary for optimal T-cell immunotherapy efficacy[3]. The discovery of APLNR underscores that, in addition to the “usual suspect” genes (MHC, B2M, JAK1/2, etc.), there are other tumor-intrinsic regulators (such as certain G-protein coupled receptors like APLNR) that significantly influence a tumor’s visibility to the immune system. Ongoing research continues to identify such factors, expanding our understanding of tumor genes that condition immunotherapy success.

Finally, for CD8⁺ T cells to eliminate cancer cells, the tumor must be capable of undergoing T cell–induced apoptosis. This means that the pathways by which T cells trigger target-cell death need to be intact within the cancer cell. One major cytotoxic mechanism is the Fas–Fas ligand interaction: activated CD8⁺ T cells (and NK cells) can express FasL (CD95L) on their surface, which binds to the Fas (CD95) receptor on target cells to initiate extrinsic apoptosis. Tumor cells that lose Fas expression, or downstream apoptotic effectors like caspase-8, become resistant to this form of T-cell killing. Empirical evidence for this comes from clinical and experimental studies. Xiao et al. (2019) found that colorectal cancers which do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors often exhibit loss of Fas (CD95) expression or function, suggesting that the inability of T cells to engage the Fas death pathway allowed those tumors to escape immunotherapy[4]. Consistently, CASP8 (the gene encoding caspase-8, the key enzyme activated by Fas signaling) is a known “previously identified” gene whose inactivation can confer resistance to T-cell cytotoxicity[1]. In the CRISPR screen mentioned above, CASP8 loss was among the changes that protected tumor cells from T-cell killing, underlining that an operative extrinsic apoptosis pathway is necessary for immune-mediated tumor cell eradication[1]. In sum, tumor-intrinsic defects in apoptotic machinery – such as losing Fas or caspase-8 – can enable cancer cells to survive despite an ongoing T-cell attack. Therefore, an array of tumor-intrinsic genes – from antigen presentation (MHC-I heavy chains, B2M, peptide transporters) and IFN-γ signaling (IFNGR1/2, JAK1/2, etc.) to novel modulators (like APLNR) and pro-apoptotic effectors (Fas/CD95, caspase-8) – are all essential for cancer cells to be properly recognized and killed by CD8⁺ T cells during immunotherapy[1][2][3]. Disruption of any of these key tumor-intrinsic genes can undermine the immune system’s ability to identify and destroy malignant cells, leading to immune escape and therapy failure.","Sade-Feldman, M., Jiao, Y.

Molecular Cancer Research, 17(2), 420–430. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0455","The effective recognition and killing of cancer cells by CD8⁺ T cells in immunotherapies depend fundamentally on the tumor-intrinsic genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, particularly the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) pathway components [1]. Key essential genes include the human leukocyte antigen class I genes (\(HLA-I\)), beta-2-microglobulin (\(B2M\)), and antigen processing machinery components like the transporters associated with antigen presentation (\(TAP1\), \(TAP2\)) [1, 2, 3]. Other critical genes include upstream regulators such as interferon regulatory factor 1 (\(IRF1\)) and genes involved in pro-apoptotic pathways or metabolic checkpoints [4, 5, 6]. 

For CD8⁺ T-cell-based immunotherapies to be effective, cancer cells must be able to present tumor-associated antigens via surface MHC-I molecules, allowing T cells to recognize and eliminate them. The integrity and expression of specific tumor-intrinsic genes are essential for this process. Key gene categories include: Antigen Presentation Machinery (APM) Genes:\(HLA-I\) and \(B2M\): The MHC-I complex on the tumor cell surface is composed of a heavy chain (encoded by \(HLA-A\), \(HLA-B\), or \(HLA-C\) genes in humans) and a light chain, \(B2M\). Loss-of-function mutations or downregulation of \(HLA-I\) or \(B2M\) are common mechanisms of immune evasion that result in resistance to T-cell-mediated killing [1, 7].\(TAP1\) and \(TAP2\): These genes encode the transporter associated with antigen presentation, which moves antigenic peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC-I molecules [3]. Reduced expression of \(TAP1\) or \(TAP2\) in tumor cells, sometimes mediated by factors like IL-4 signaling, impairs antigen presentation and confers resistance to T cells [3, 2].Upstream Regulators: The transcription factor \(IRF1\) regulates the expression of MHC-I and MHC-II molecules [4]. Tumor-intrinsic proteins like NPM1 can associate with IRF1 and sequester it, suppressing the expression of antigen presentation machinery components, including the transactivator \(NLRC5\), and promoting immune evasion [4]. The STING pathway is also critical, and its epigenetic silencing in tumor cells can drive resistance by impairing type I interferon signaling and antigenicity [8].Apoptosis and Metabolic Checkpoint Genes:Apoptotic Regulators: The transcription factor ZFX regulates key apoptosis genes, including Caspase-3, which is central to T-cell-mediated killing [5]. Loss of ZFX in tumor cells makes them resistant to T cell killing [5]. Conversely, the gene Irf6, when repressed by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition factors like ZEB1, renders tumor cells less sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effects of TNF-\(\alpha \) [9].Metabolic Genes: Tumor-intrinsic fatty acid synthase (\(FASN\)) acts as a metabolic checkpoint that restricts T cell immunity [6]. Depletion of \(FASN\) enhances the cytolytic response of T cells and primes cancer cells for mitochondrial apoptosis [6]. The gene Decr2 has also been identified as a regulator of immune-mediated killing, potentially via ferroptosis pathways [10].Immune Checkpoint Ligands:\(PD-L1\): Programmed death-ligand 1 (\(PD-L1\)) expression in tumor cells engages PD-1 on T cells to suppress T cell activity [6]. FASN depletion can prevent the adaptive induction of PD-L1 in response to interferon-gamma, making cells more susceptible to T cells [6]. The loss of checkpoint kinase 2 (\(Chek2\)) expression in glioblastoma enhances T-cell activation and PD-L1 expression, suggesting it may also play a role in modulating immune response [2]. ","[1] Fritz, P., & Ungefroren, H.

66,Melanoma,"Does the strength of immune-mediated selection (immunoediting) on tumors differ by patient sex and age, and if so, how do these differences shape tumor evolution and immune escape across cancers?",Chi-Ping,chi-ping.day@nih.gov,"ANSWER: Yes, the strength and nature of immune-mediated selection (immunoediting) on tumors differ significantly based on patient sex and age, which in turn distinctly shapes tumor evolution and immune escape mechanisms.

Evidence suggests that females, who have a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases, may mount more robust anti-tumor immune responses, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, implying a different selective pressure on tumors compared to males (PMID:34647433).

Age has a more profound and multifaceted effect, primarily through the process of immunosenescence—the age-related decline and remodeling of the immune system. In younger, immunologically competent individuals, strong immunoediting exerts significant selective pressure, forcing tumors to evolve specific immune escape mechanisms such as the loss of neoantigens, downregulation of antigen presentation machinery (e.g., HLA loss of heterozygosity), and epigenetic silencing of immunogenic genes (PMID:30894752; PMID:33276569). This Darwinian selection results in highly edited, less immunogenic tumors.

In contrast, with advancing age, immunosenescence weakens this selective pressure. Key features of immunosenescence, including thymic involution (reducing the pool of diverse, tumor-recognizing naive T cells), the accumulation of dysfunctional and senescent T cells, and an increase in immunosuppressive cells like regulatory T cells (Tregs), collectively impair the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells (PMID:32425946; PMID:37179335; PMID:39793777). This diminished immune surveillance means tumors in older individuals may face weaker specific editing pressure. Concurrently, immunosenescence fosters a pro-tumorigenic state of chronic, low-grade inflammation known as ""inflammaging,"" which creates a systemically permissive and immunosuppressive microenvironment that facilitates tumor growth and progression non-specifically (PMID:35983061; PMID:39793777).

Therefore, tumor evolution is shaped by antigen-specific immunoediting pressure in the young, leading to immune-sculpted tumors. In the elderly, tumor progression is driven more by a general failure of immune surveillance and a permissive, inflammatory milieu, which may allow for the survival of more immunogenic tumor cells that would otherwise have been eliminated in a younger host. These differences underscore the need to consider age and sex as critical variables in cancer immunology and the development of personalized immunotherapies.

### **Investigation Report: The Influence of Sex and Age on Tumor Immunoediting**

#### **1. Understanding Immunoediting and its Role in Tumor Evolution**

**1.1. The Concept of Immunoediting**

Immunoediting is a dynamic process describing the relationship between tumor cells and the immune system, comprising three distinct phases: elimination, equilibrium, and escape (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoediting). This concept evolved from the cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis, which posited that the immune system acts as an extrinsic tumor suppressor. The recognition that the immune system can both suppress and facilitate tumor progression led to the refined ""cancer immunoediting"" hypothesis. The three phases, known as the ""three Es,"" describe the complete process:
*   **Elimination:** The immune system successfully recognizes and destroys developing tumor cells.
*   **Equilibrium:** A period where the immune system controls tumor growth but does not eliminate it, exerting selective pressure on tumor cells.
*   **Escape:** Tumor cell variants that can evade immune recognition or destruction proliferate, leading to clinically apparent disease (PMID:15032581).

*Note: Evidence pertaining to histiocytoma in dogs was provided but deemed irrelevant as it does not address the concept of immunoediting in the context of this question (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histiocytoma_(dog)).*

**1.2. Immunoediting as a Driver of Tumor Evolution and Immune Escape**

Immune pressure forces cancers to acquire traits that disrupt anti-tumor immunity, selecting for and reinforcing these immune evasion mechanisms during tumor evolution. This process can lead to two main outcomes. In some cases, immunogenic subclones are eliminated through immunoediting, resulting in a clonally selected, less immunogenic tumor. In other cases, cancer cells develop resistance to immunoediting, which leads to a tumor with high intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), a state associated with poor patient outcomes and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (PMID:39748116).

Multiple studies across different cancer types illustrate the mechanisms by which immunoediting shapes tumor evolution:

*   **Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):** Analysis of early-stage, untreated NSCLC reveals that the immune microenvironment exerts strong selection pressure, leading to multiple routes of immune evasion. Sparsely infiltrated tumors show signs of historical immune editing, such as a decrease in neoantigen editing over time or copy-number loss of neoantigens. In contrast, immune-infiltrated regions exhibit ongoing immunoediting, characterized by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in human leukocyte antigens (HLA) or the depletion of expressed neoantigens. Promoter hypermethylation of genes containing neoantigenic mutations has been identified as a key epigenetic mechanism of immunoediting in these tumors (PMID:30894752). Evidence of active immune escape, including impaired antigen presentation and HLA LOH, can be found even in pre-invasive lesions that progress to NSCLC, and these processes continue to evolve in the invasive stage (PMID:33276569).
*   **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):** In patients with multifocal HCC, immunoediting and immune microenvironments show significant heterogeneity. Lesions arising from multicentric occurrence (MO) typically undergo immunoediting, whereas those from intrahepatic metastasis (IM) do not, due to lower immune infiltration. Mechanisms like HLA LOH are also observed, hampering the presentation of neoantigens (PMID:31887370). Furthermore, the degree of immune intratumoral heterogeneity (immune-ITH) dictates the evolutionary path. Tumors with low immune-ITH tend to escape via HLA LOH and immunoediting, whereas tumors with high immune-ITH evolve toward a more immunosuppressive microenvironment (PMID:33431814).
*   **Glioma:** In mouse models of glioma, immune pressure profoundly shapes the tumor's clonal composition. Tumors grown in immunocompetent mice display reduced clonality compared to those in immunodeficient mice, with the emergence of immune escape clones. These edited tumor cells are characterized by an IFN-γ-mediated response signature and an upregulation of genes involved in immunosuppression (PMID:32603315).
*   **Colorectal Cancer:** In a mouse model of hypermutated colorectal cancer, the effects of immunoediting were found to be weak, with neutral accumulation of mutations being the dominant evolutionary force. However, targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway with immune checkpoint blockers was shown to effectively potentiate T-cell-dependent immunoediting, highlighting how therapeutic intervention can amplify this selective pressure (PMID:29296022).

#### **2. Influence of Patient Sex on Immunoediting**

The strength of immune-mediated selection appears to be modulated by patient sex. A study investigating outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy found that a pre-existing immune-mediated inflammatory disease (pre-IMID) was significantly associated with improved overall survival (OS) in female patients but not in male patients (p = 0.012 for females, p = 0.35 for males). This suggests that females with certain pre-existing immune conditions can mount a more effective anti-tumor response when treated with ICIs. The study authors note that this finding may be related to the fact that autoimmune diseases are more common in women. The presence of autoantibodies, which are associated with improved OS in cancer patients, may also contribute to these sex-based differences in outcomes, although further research is required to elucidate the precise mechanisms (PMID:34647433).

#### **3. Influence of Patient Age on Immunoediting**

Patient age profoundly impacts the immune system through a process called immunosenescence, which significantly alters the capacity for immune-mediated selection on tumors.

**3.1. Immunosenescence: The Aging of the Immune System**

Immunosenescence is a complex and dynamic phenomenon characterized by the age-related decline and remodeling of immune system function, affecting both innate and adaptive immunity (PMID:35983061; PMID:34391943; PMID:33551332; PMID:33165716). This process is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, neoplasms, and autoimmune diseases, as well as poor vaccination efficacy (PMID:37179335). It is not simply a decline but a remodeling process resulting from a lifetime of antigenic exposure and other stressors (PMID:33165716). Key hallmarks of immunosenescence include thymic involution, shifts in immune cell populations, and a state of chronic low-grade inflammation.

**3.2. Hallmarks of Immunosenescence and Their Impact on Anti-Tumor Immunity**

*   **Thymic Involution:** The thymus, the primary organ for T cell development, progressively atrophies with age. This leads to a reduced output of new, naive T cells and a consequently restricted T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire (PMID:32425946; PMID:37179335; PMID:30269199). This decline severely compromises the ability of the immune system to recognize and respond to novel antigens, including tumor-specific neoantigens (PMID:32425946).
*   **Changes in Immune Cell Subsets:**
    *   **T Cells:** Aging is associated with a loss of naive T cells and an accumulation of highly differentiated memory T cells, senescent T cells (often CD28-), and exhausted T cells (PMID:37179335; PMID:30269199; PMID:32747977). The number and proportion of immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells also increase in the elderly, which can promote tumor growth and metastasis by suppressing anti-tumor T cell responses (PMID:35983061; PMID:32425946).
    *   **B Cells:** The B cell compartment undergoes remodeling with age, leading to decreased repertoire diversity, reduced efficiency of antibody responses, and diminished production of high-affinity antibodies (PMID:35983061; PMID:30269199).
    *   **Innate Immune Cells:** The function of innate immune cells also declines. Neutrophil functions such as phagocytosis, ROS generation, and chemotaxis are reduced (PMID:30269199). While Natural Killer (NK) cell numbers increase, their cytotoxic function towards cancer cells is reduced with age (PMID:30269199). As NK cells play a role in clearing senescent cells, this functional decline can be detrimental (PMID:36386442). Furthermore, aging is accompanied by an increase in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which suppress T cell responses (PMID:30269199).
*   **Inflammaging:** A hallmark of aging is a systemic state of chronic, low-grade, sterile inflammation, termed ""inflammaging."" This is characterized by elevated circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-α (PMID:35983061; PMID:34391943; PMID:37179335). This inflammatory state can create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that promotes myelopoiesis and increases immunosuppressive cells like Tregs and M2 macrophages, ultimately supporting tumor progression (PMID:35983061; PMID:34432073).
*   **Cellular Senescence:** The accumulation of senescent cells is a key feature of aging. These cells secrete a complex mix of pro-inflammatory factors known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which is a major contributor to inflammaging and can induce paracrine senescence in nearby healthy cells (PMID:37179335; PMID:33551332).

**3.3. Implications of Immunosenescence for Immunoediting and Cancer Progression**

The collective changes of immunosenescence have direct consequences for immune-mediated selection on tumors.

*   **Impaired Immune Surveillance and Increased Cancer Risk:** The decline in immune function, particularly the reduced TCR diversity and accumulation of dysfunctional T cells, leads to impaired immune surveillance and an increased risk of cancer in older individuals (PMID:35983061; PMID:37179335; PMID:26702035). The involuted thymus is less capable of generating T cells that can recognize the neoantigens arising from somatic mutations in tumor cells (PMID:32425946).
*   **Creation of a Pro-Tumorigenic Microenvironment:** Immunosenescence fosters a microenvironment conducive to tumor growth through chronic inflammation and the accumulation of immunosuppressive cells, which actively inhibit anti-tumor immune responses (PMID:39793777).
*   **Reduced Efficacy of Immunotherapy:** The immune dysfunction associated with aging poses significant challenges for cancer therapies that rely on a competent immune system, such as immunotherapy. The impact of immunosenescence on the efficacy of these treatments is a critical area of research (PMID:37179335; PMID:39793777).
*   **Context-Specific Nuances:** While the overarching trend is a decline in immune efficacy with age, some evidence highlights context-specific effects. For instance, one study concluded that immunosenescence of T and NK cells was unlikely to be the cause of increased gestational trophoblastic neoplasia incidence in older patients (PMID:20626184). Another study in pediatric heart transplant recipients found that older age at transplantation was a protective factor against late infections, a finding that runs counter to the general paradigm of immunosenescence (PMID:20869265). These findings underscore the complexity of aging's impact on immunity across different physiological and pathological contexts.","1. Gulati N. et al. (2021).

(PMID:33431814: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33431814)","The strength of immune-mediated selection (immunoediting) on tumors varies significantly by both patient sex and age, with younger and female patients demonstrating stronger immune selection pressure during tumor development.[1] These differences fundamentally shape tumor evolution by influencing which mutations are tolerated, the composition of the tumor microenvironment, and ultimately the mechanisms by which tumors escape immune surveillance.

Sex-Based Differences in Immunoediting
Female patients exhibit approximately twice as much MHC class II-based immune selection compared to males, with younger females showing compounded effects.[1] This stronger immune pressure in females results in tumors that accumulate fewer poorly presented driver mutations, suggesting more rigorous immunoediting during tumor development.[1] The enhanced immunoediting in females is mechanistically driven by X-chromosome gene dosage effects (due to incomplete X-inactivation) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) signaling, which activates CD8+ T cells.[2-3] However, this stronger immune selection paradoxically leads female tumors to develop distinct escape mechanisms: they exhibit greater T-cell dysfunction, higher expression of inhibitory checkpoint molecules (including PD-L1), and increased abundance of immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and cancer-associated fibroblasts.[4]

In contrast, male tumors experience weaker immune selection but develop a T-cell-excluded phenotype with impaired neoantigen presentation.[4] Androgen receptor signaling in males directly inhibits CD8+ T-cell stemness and promotes T-cell exhaustion through PD-1 transcriptional activation.[2][5] Male tumors also show loss of chromosome Y (LOY), which promotes immunosuppressive microenvironment remodeling.[2]

Age-Based Differences in Immunoediting
Younger patients demonstrate the strongest MHC-based immune selection, with tumors accumulating significantly fewer poorly presented driver mutations compared to older patients.[1] This reflects more robust immune surveillance in younger individuals with intact adaptive immunity. However, immunosenescence—the age-related decline in immune function—progressively weakens immunoediting capacity in older patients.[6-7] Aging is characterized by reduced naive T-cell production, accumulation of exhausted T cells, myeloid bias in hematopoiesis, increased regulatory immune cells, and chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging).[6-8]

The weakened immune selection in older patients allows tumors to retain more immunogenic mutations that would have been eliminated in younger hosts.[9] Paradoxically, this may explain why older patients sometimes show better responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors—their tumors may harbor more targetable neoantigens due to less stringent immunoediting.[10]

Combined Effects and Clinical Implications
The intersection of sex and age creates distinct immunoediting landscapes. Younger female patients experience the most stringent immune selection, resulting in highly edited tumors with sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms.[1] This may contribute to observations that younger patients, particularly females, show reduced response rates to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy.[1][11] In non-small cell lung cancer, younger male patients treated with immunotherapy alone demonstrated significantly worse survival compared to older males, while addition of chemotherapy reduced this disparity.[11]

These sex- and age-dependent differences in immunoediting have important therapeutic implications. The distinct immune escape mechanisms—T-cell dysfunction and checkpoint upregulation in females versus T-cell exclusion in males—suggest that combination strategies may need sex-specific optimization.[4][12] Similarly, age-related immunosenescence may require interventions targeting senescent cells or metabolic reprogramming to restore effective antitumor immunity in elderly patients.[7-8]

In general, female patients and younger individuals experience stronger immunoediting pressure on tumors than male or older patients [1]. This heightened immune selection means tumors arising in young and female hosts are more likely to lose or avoid highly immunogenic antigens – they accumulate driver mutations that are poorly presented by the patient’s MHC molecules (i.e. “immune-invisible” mutations) due to early elimination of immunogenic tumor cells [1]. By contrast, the weaker immune surveillance in males or older adults results in relatively less editing of tumor antigens. As a result, tumor evolution is shaped differently: cancers in young females are often enriched in immune-evasive clones that have escaped T-cell recognition, whereas tumors in older or male patients may retain more immunogenic neoantigens [2][1]. These differences have broad implications across cancers. Strong immunoediting in younger females can leave tumors better adapted to evade immunity, which is one reason this group tends to have lower response rates to immune checkpoint blockade [1]. Conversely, the relative lack of early immune pruning in older or male patients can mean their tumors maintain more visible targets for therapy, aligning with observations that male sex and advanced age are sometimes associated with better outcomes on T-cell–based immunotherapies [1]. In summary, patient sex and age significantly influence the intensity of tumor immunoediting, thereby shaping tumor evolution and immune escape patterns across cancer types through the differential elimination (or preservation) of immunogenic tumor cell clones.

The strength of anti-tumor immune surveillance – and thus immunoediting – is modulated by host factors like sex and age, leading to distinct evolutionary pathways for tumors. Sex differences in immunity are well documented: females generally mount more robust innate and adaptive immune responses than males (e.g. higher antibody titers and T-cell counts) and are more prone to autoimmune reactions [1]. Correspondingly, preclinical models have shown sexual dimorphism in how the immune system constrains tumor heterogeneity [1]. These immune disparities translate into differential tumor editing. In a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of >9,000 patients, female patients’ tumors showed significantly stronger immune selection against tumor mutations than those of males [1]. Specifically, women’s tumors tended to lack driver mutations that were effectively presented by their HLA alleles, implying that highly visible (immunogenic) tumor cells were purged by the immune system. No inherent differences in HLA genotypes were found between sexes, so the skew in observed mutations reflects stronger immunoediting in females rather than genetic bias [1]. This means that by the time of clinical presentation, tumors in females have been more thoroughly “edited” to escape immune detection. Indeed, one study found female-derived tumors harbor more poorly MHC-presented driver mutations compared to male-derived tumors [1]. Consistent with this, females often show lower efficacy from immunotherapies that rely on tumor antigens – a meta-analysis of trials across multiple cancers found that women derived a smaller survival benefit from checkpoint inhibitors than men [3][1]. This poorer response in women is thought to stem, at least in part, from more rigorous immunoediting eliminating targetable neoantigens in their tumors before treatment [1]. In other words, a history of stronger immune pressure in female patients may leave fewer immunogenic “footprints” for therapies to exploit, illustrating how sex shapes tumor immune escape.

Age-related differences in immune selection are also evident. Immune competence generally peaks in young adulthood and wanes with age due to immunosenescence: older individuals exhibit reduced T-cell proliferative capacity, a contracting naïve T-cell repertoire, and impaired antigen presentation (e.g. diminished IL-2 production and MHC-II expression)[1]. Consequently, younger patients mount more potent anti-tumor immune responses, which can impose greater selective pressure on emerging tumor clones. Castro et al. (2020) observed exactly this pattern: across cancer types, younger patients’ tumors bore signs of stronger MHC-mediated immunoediting than those of older patients [1]. Tumors arising in young hosts had fewer driver mutations that were well-presented by the host’s MHC, again indicating that visible tumor antigens were efficiently eliminated during tumor development [1]. Notably, younger females showed the most pronounced effect, with nearly double the degree of class II–restricted immune selection compared to others [1]. On the other hand, tumors in older patients experience relatively weaker immune pruning, allowing more immunogenic mutations to persist. Empirically, tumor types that commonly present at younger ages (such as thyroid cancer and low-grade glioma) have the highest MHC-driven selection against tumor antigens, supporting the idea that a youthful immune system intensifies immunoediting [1]. The flip side is that cancers arising in older adults, under less vigilant immune surveillance, may retain a broader diversity of neoantigens and subclones. This has observable consequences for therapy and disease course. For example, clinical studies in melanoma found that older patients respond significantly better to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy than younger patients, despite immunosenescence. For every decade increase in age, the odds of response to PD-1 blockade improved – a 62-year-old had markedly higher likelihood of tumor regression than a 52-year-old [4]. The counterintuitive benefit in the elderly is explained by tumor immunoediting: younger patients’ tumors, forged in the crucible of a vigorous immune system, are often dominated by immune-resistant cells (and enriched in suppressive regulatory T cells) that blunt immunotherapy efficacy. Older patients, having experienced milder immune filtering, can present with tumors that still carry immunogenic T-cell targets and fewer intratumoral Tregs, making checkpoint inhibitors more effective. These findings underscore that age-related immune pressure – or lack thereof – fundamentally sculpts the tumor’s antigenic landscape and its susceptibility to immune attack.

Mechanistically, stronger immune-mediated selection (as seen in young and female patients) drives tumor evolution toward immune escape phenotypes. The immune system effectively edits the tumor by destroying cells bearing highly antigenic mutations, thereby favoring the outgrowth of variants that evade T-cell recognition [2]. Over time, this results in tumors composed of less immunogenic clones. Milo et al. (2018) elegantly demonstrated this principle in a mouse lymphoma model: immune-competent hosts showed dramatically reduced intratumoral genetic diversity, as immune responses selectively eliminated more immunogenic subclones and allowed immune-resistant clones to dominate [2]. Thus, a vigorous immune system can paradoxically make surviving tumors more “invisible” – a form of Darwinian selection where cancer cells with poor antigen presentation or antigen loss have a relative fitness advantage. In patients with robust immunity (e.g. young adults, especially females), tumor progression may therefore be tightly coupled with immune escape: only those tumor cell lineages that can avoid immune detection (through low neoantigen presentation, antigenic modulation, or an immunosuppressive microenvironment) continue to propagate [1]. This immune shaping of tumors is less intense in patients with weaker immunity (older age or immunosuppressed states), meaning such tumors might retain highly immunogenic neoantigens simply because the host immune system did not effectively purge them.

Across different cancers, these sex- and age-influenced patterns of immunoediting help explain variations in tumor immunogenicity and outcomes. Cancers arising in younger patients or in females may need to evolve immune escape mechanisms early, leading to lower baseline immunogenicity and more frequent resistance to immunotherapies. In contrast, cancers in older or male patients, facing milder immune scrutiny, often carry more immunogenic mutations at diagnosis – which can be leveraged therapeutically but also indicates those tumors endured less immune suppression during emergence [1][4]. Ultimately, the interplay between host sex/age and tumor immunoediting defines a spectrum of tumor evolutionary paths: from highly edited, immune-evading tumors in immunologically “strong” hosts (young, female) to more antigen-rich tumors in immunologically “weaker” hosts (older, male). These differences shape how cancers grow and respond to the immune system, with important implications for designing age- and sex-tailored cancer immunotherapies [1]. By understanding that immunoediting pressure is not uniform across patient populations, clinicians and researchers can better predict tumor behavior and optimize treatments to counteract the specific immune escape strategies tumors have adopted in different demographic groups.","Castro, A., Marty Pyke, R., Zhang, X., Thompson, W.

These differences shape tumor evolution by selecting for immunologically ""invisible"" tumor variants in these patient groups, which influences clinical outcomes, particularly response to immunotherapies. 

Cancer immunoediting is a dynamic process where the host immune system initially eliminates transformed cells (elimination phase) but can also select for immune-resistant variants (equilibrium and escape phases), driving tumor progression. The intensity of this selective pressure varies with patient sex and age due to underlying differences in immune function and hormonal influences. 
Differences by Sex
Females generally mount a more robust innate and adaptive immune response compared to males, influenced by sex hormones and X-chromosome-linked genes. This heightened immune surveillance leads to: 
Stronger Immunoediting in Females: Tumors that develop in female patients tend to have experienced stronger immune selection early in their history.
Accumulation of Poorly Presented Mutations: Consequently, female patients' tumors, when clinically diagnosed, are more likely to harbor driver mutations that are less effectively presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules. This makes the tumors less ""visible"" to T cells at the time of diagnosis.
Lower Tumor Antigenicity: Male tumors generally exhibit a higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and more cancer germline antigens, making them more antigenic overall than female tumors.
Immune Escape Mechanisms: To evade the stronger initial female immune response, tumors may develop enhanced local immunosuppressive mechanisms, including a higher abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and higher expression of immune checkpoints like PD-L1 within the tumor microenvironment. 
Differences by Age
Age also influences immune selection due to age-related immune decline (immunosenescence). 
Stronger Immunoediting in Younger Patients: Younger patients exhibit stronger immune selection compared to older patients. The effects of MHC-based selection on driver mutations are particularly strong in younger individuals.
Weaker Immunoediting in Older Patients: Older patients experience a weaker immune response, potentially leaving their diagnosed tumors more ""visible"" to the immune system in terms of neoantigen presentation. This is partly due to a reduced CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio and T cell senescence in older individuals. 
Combined Sex and Age Effects
Sex and age effects are cumulative. Tumors in younger females exhibit the strongest immune selection, resulting in tumors that are the least visible to the immune system at diagnosis. In contrast, tumors in older males face the weakest immune selection, meaning their tumors are generally more immunologically visible when they become clinically apparent. 
Shaping Tumor Evolution and Immune Escape
These differences in selection pressure shape tumor evolution by determining the immunogenic landscape of the tumor at diagnosis: 
Tumor Evolution: In younger females, the intense early immune pressure selects for cancer cells that have already acquired mutations allowing them to escape detection, leading to a tumor composed of immunologically invisible clones.
Immune Escape: The mechanism of escape in younger females involves a depletion of highly immunogenic mutant peptides (poor presentation by MHC molecules).
Implications for Therapy: The extent of this pre-diagnosis immunoediting influences response to therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Younger and female patients may show poorer response rates to ICI monotherapy because the immune system, once reactivated by ICIs, has fewer high-quality, recognizable neoantigens to target. Older and male patients, whose tumors are generally more immunogenic and less ""edited"", may benefit more from ICI treatments. ","[1] Castro, A., Pyke, R. M., Zhang, X., Maj, C., De Vries, C.
